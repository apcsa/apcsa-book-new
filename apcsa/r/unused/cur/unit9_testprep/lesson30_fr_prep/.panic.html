<p audio="1">If you followed our advice in the past two lessons you can go into the AP exam confident that you've done everything you can to be ready.
But even with all that preparation, there's bound to be some questions on the exam that you just don't know the answer to.  If this happens, remain calm!<br/><br/>
There's no reason to panic.  Just skip the questions that are giving you trouble and come back to them later if you have time.  
You'll have plenty of other opportunities to show everything that you know about computer science and programming!
