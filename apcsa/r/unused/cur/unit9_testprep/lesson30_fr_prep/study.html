Now is your last chance to really study hard before your exam.  You know better than anyone else what your 
strengths and weaknesses in this course are.  Don't be afraid to repeatedly go back to lessons that gave you trouble the first time through the course.<br/><br/>

This is also an excellent time to go back and retake quizes in each lesson.  Try to focus on lessons that are related to problems that gave you trouble
 on your practice exam.  Working out solutions to similar problems repeatedly will help you get used to this style of work.
