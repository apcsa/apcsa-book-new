<p audio="1">Some simple strategy will help you deal with those tricky multiple-choice questions that you aren't sure about.
First, you should understand that it's okay to guess on a multiple-choice question.  The AP exam grading scheme penalizes you for 
incorrect answers, but not as badly as you might think.  <br/><br/><b>As a general rule, if you have a hunch that an answer might be right or if you can elimiate 
one or more potential answers, go ahead and guess away!</b></p>
