<p audio="1">Some simple strategy will help you deal with those tricky 
multiple-choice questions that you aren't sure about. First, you 
should understand that it's okay to guess on a multiple-choice 
question. In fact, it's preferable. The AP exam grading scheme
<i>no longer</i> penalizes you for incorrect answers.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p audio="2" class="quoteBrown">
As a general rule, first see if you can eliminate 
one or more potential answers, and then go ahead and guess away.
And, if you find there are only a few seconds left to finish several
multiple choice questions, make sure you have every question filled when the time
ends, even if that means guessing randomly!
