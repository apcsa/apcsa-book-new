The <tt>Critter</tt> class overrides the <tt>Actor</tt> <tt>act</tt> method,
calling five methods:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">getActors, which gathers interesting actors into an <tt>ArrayList</tt>;</li>
	<li audio="4">processActors, which processes the actors in the list;</li>
	<li audio="5">getMoveLocations, which gathers possible locations to move to;</li>
	<li audio="6">selectMoveLocation, which chooses one of the possibilities;</li>
	<li audio="7">makeMove, which moves the Critter to its new location.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="8">
By default, it gathers the neighboring actors, "eats" them (removes
them from the grid), and moves to a randomly chosen empty neighboring location.
Appendix C contains the <tt>Critter</tt> code.
