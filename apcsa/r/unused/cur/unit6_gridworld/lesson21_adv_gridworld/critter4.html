The case study goes on to describe two classes that extend <tt>Critter</tt>:
<tt>ChameleonCritter</tt> and <tt>CrabCritter</tt>.
</p>
<ul>
<li audio="3">
A <tt>ChameleonCritter</tt> gathers the same actors as a <tt>Critter</tt> does.
Instead of eating them, however, it chooses a random actor from the list
and changes its own color to match that of the chosen actor.
It moves like a <tt>Critter</tt>, except that it also turns toward the new location
as it moves.
</li>
<li audio="4">
A <tt>CrabCritter</tt> gathers actors that are
located either immediately in front of it, immediately to its left-front,
or immediately to its right-front.
If those actors aren't <tt>Rocks</tt> or <tt>Critters</tt>, it eats them.
It then moves randomly to the right or left, unless both locations are blocked,
in which case it turns 90&deg; randomly to the left or right.
</li>
</ul>
