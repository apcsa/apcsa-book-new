<p audio="2">The next three weeks of activities all involve working with the <tt>GridWorld</tt> program supplied by AP
CS. <tt>GridWorld</tt> comes with a writeup, called a "case study", that describes the features of the program and guides the
reader's exploration of the program.</p>

<p>
Activities will mainly involve analyzing and modifying program segments, as in the Monty Hall and sound sampling lessons. <tt>GridWorld</tt> differs from those other programs, however, in the amount and complexity of code you'll be studying. It involves several interacting classes, totaling around five hundred lines of code. Tasks such as predicting program behavior and making sure that modifications don't have any undesirable side effects will pose more of a challenge in this setting.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting aspect of this program is its heavy use of inheritance. <tt>GridWorld</tt> provides an <tt>Actor</tt> class that can move and "act". Almost all the activities involve designing or analyzing classes that set up different kinds of actors via inheritance from the <tt>Actor</tt> class.
</p>

<p audio="4">The first week of activities is based on parts 1 and 2 of the case study. We will set up <tt>GridWorld</tt> in the next step. Away we go!</p>
