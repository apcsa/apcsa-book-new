Write and test code to implement <tt>CircleBugs</tt>, 
<tt>SpiralBugs</tt>, and <tt>ZBugs</tt>
as described in exercises 1, 2, and 3 on pages 13 and 14 of the case study.
(All of these will provide a constructor and an <tt>act</tt> method.)
Also invent a <tt>Bug</tt> of your own that acts differently from those
described in the case study.
