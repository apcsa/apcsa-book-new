TODO===========================
Make charcount not static -- steps 2-7
 - basically, we don't want them to associate recursion with 'static'
 - could leave it this way, but have an direct explanation about recursive funcs don't need to be static

turn steps 5-7 to multiple choice
or, keep #7 as a bs but add a "and how did you figure it out" to the question


step 8 is confusing... "can't always call itself"... 

step 9 -- 'stack' isn't totally clear (the picture shows 'nested' robots)

step 10 -- video!!

steps 21/22 -- The contains1MoreThan problem does have a bug but the bug appears 
unrelated to recursion -- it seems to be that you are comparing strings with == instead of .equals 
in the final else clause of the algorithm.

-----------

Turn intro4 into multiple choice?
Or, maybe, just fix the title.

intro5 as well.

Anywhere: use nestbot3.png (from art/scenes) as a char in a talkbubble.
