LESSON 4 TODO

- check all brainstorms for canned responses
- supply feedback for all other assessments.

 - add images already written:
 looking under hood, etc.

-- step63 table is ugly -- add "id=tableBlue"

Testing
Mike Clancy's entries for Aug 22 are in upper case.

========= projects

Note, leapYear should be renamed to LeapDay, and LeapYear2 to LeapYear.

And, why do we do the whole leapXCount business as an int?  Perhaps they don't know/have practice with booleans yet, but...
A big problem with LeapYear2, really, is that leapYearCount is set to 0 to start, which can make them write weird if structures
since they don't actually have to set it.

Regular bluej projects
*  "Sources of misuse" (step 6) is changed to use "Refillable version2" from lesson 4.
   (this is a copy of Refillable version2 in lesson 3
*  Step 42, "Finding a bug" uses BuggyRefillable.   

BlueJ exercises:
*	"using nested if statements", step 31.
   Refillable_nested_ifs
*  Completing setLeapDay, step 49  (not working quite yet -- sept 22) 
*  Determining the number of leap days, step 51
*  LeapYearTester  lesson4/LeapYearTester, step 52, 
   
???
*	lesson4/ifStatements should get flushed, I think, since they're using Refillable2 for earlier stuff.





============== Sean Morris - June 2010
=========================== Would be nice and Larger Questions:
- Step 17 -- I added another piece of code to the one written showing you can access the myUseUpCallCount directly
          -- wasn't sure the students would get the call to the method currentAmount() in side the 
             if's parentheses -- 


============================ To Be Done
-  if...else vs. if ... then ... else? [FIXED]
-  Introduce no bracket if statements  first line executes [ADDED]

-  "Sources of misuse" : the graphic is confusing. I am not sure what we are trying to do
					- what is num and how does it relate to constructor?
					- Is the graphic referring to refill's method body?
					[THIS GRAPHIC NEEDS FIXING; I COMMENTED IT OUT]
-  Step 7: It should be averageUse as the answer but my buggyRefillable is not buggy. 
		   The conditionals need to be removed. [FIXED]
           Do we mess with BlueJ now or wait?
			- change feedback on to be Correct it breaks the object
-  Step 8: 	Concept of validation -- could use Password or Username checking 
			to bring back in Strings
-  Step 8 : we refer to error message coming from BlueJ -- what do think about 
			saying that errors come from Java compiler rather than making 
			it seem that you need BlueJ to see errors.	[NOT CHANGED]
			
-  Step 10 : Add examples [NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS (steps got renumbered)
-  Step 12: Have we talked about control flow yet? I think the box is going 
			to be difficult for the students to access
					-- a diagram?
				 	-- now we switch to "validate arguements" [CHECK REWRITE][looks good -smm]
				--> Practice right here on creating the statement that evaluate the simple if 
				--> Maybe a MC that provides a series of examples here before doing next step?
				[CHECK REWRITE MJC][looks good -- smm]
-  Step 13: The grey vocab box extends past where needed and creates scroll bar  
-  Step 13: There are a number of ways to get a true or false value:
								if(true) ...
								if(something == true) ....
								if(something <  somethingelse) ....
								...
								...
								...
								... [NOT SURE WHAT'S WANTED HERE]
			[Maybe overkill but have just watch student's get confused by the various ways one get use the comparison to get their values
			 - I think we cover decently and I'll try to check it out more this week.]
-  Step 34:  What are we expecting them to say? I might drop this one or change it
	[WE TALKED ABOUT THIS FRIDAY; I CHANGED IT ONLY A LITTLE]
-  BlueJ Exercises: We need to go over which Refillable classes should be open 
	and what we expect them to look like
			- Step 32 : buggyRefillable [SEE ABOVE]
			- Step 3: buggyRefiable -- should this be ifStatements [IFSTATEMENTS IS USELESS]
			- Step 39 -- LeapYear --> all code is already in file -- I hit reset to clear 
				-- how do we ensure cleared when open
			- Step 41: LeapYear2 -- the Year classes formatting is tweaky
		 		- if we removed the line numbers the sample lines could be copied to BJ?
		 		- Can we set up tests for the method to see if there code is correct?
-   VLE :
	 - Sometimes style is not applied and all text is centered and small font. It happened Step 16. 
	 	If you click another step and go back it usually 
	 resets itself -- Chrome/Safari
	  Step 30: - Animation clears the comfortLevel as soon as animation finishes
	- I changed the color of all text in talk bubble to dark blue - color:#334B7B;


		
================== DONE
Step 3: -- String should be capitalized (fixed by Nathan)			
Step 3: - I missed the IfStatements folder?	-- it is back						
Step 4: - Added another sample answer
Step 5: We need to establish what they did wrong or what we intended them to do 
		 		wrong in order for Steps 4 and 5 to make sense - DONE
Step 7: **** Added line telling to students to open up editor and look at code 
	-- how else would be able to answer question?

Step 9: DONE Made the swtich - We swith to the word illegal -- how about invalid 
	or not valid in this context of your program?
Step 10 : DONE I might do like this:
						//if initialAmount is less than 0
							//print message here
						//otherwise do the following:
							...			
Step 11: Use up example should in second clause say:
					amount > myAmount
					
Step 12: 	 -- somthing is creating a horizontal scroll bar on this page
			-- "handling nonsense values" right or even handling values that don't make sense 
				in the context of the program

Step 13: ... depending on the value of a variable  vs. ... depending on whether result(true/false) 
	of evaluating a comparison or boolean operator
				-- I might approach from a different angle
					-->  The parentheses on the if are for a boolean parameter. 
						We know what this means. An "if" takes a true or false.  
						True means ... False means ... 
Step 14:  Sometimes it is useful or easier to think about the opposite of what you want 
	to provide to the if control structure 
					-- Give it a shot, what is opposite of x < y?

Step 15 : 	- get rid of It checks, get reid of if so and, "and" prints an
					- seem should be seen
					- Box 3. execution continues on the line directly following the if block(body)?		
Step 17: Consider the Refillable classes useUp method below
		 			- Answers 2 and 3 remove the and before both	
		 			
Step 22,23: Consider the useUp method below
 Step 24 : The seen answer is a bit disturbing although I see what 
		 			you are trying to do. We need some sort of tagging system? 
		 				--> Added canned response
Step 36:  "Our tests" is referring to what tests?  The examples earlier in the lesson? 
-- Changed this to our animations
Step 39: if monthNumber is 2 or 12 [REMOVE 12] and dateInMonth is 29 -- clarified what method to complete
Step 47: change to the ... to a boolean value and then rewrite the possible paths explicitly
Step 49: says "check" the ones logically possible but it is radio buttons
Step 51: Add that Sunday is considered 0 to instructions.
-  Glossary : conditional contain an example both if ... else, tertiary, and chained elses
				[I HAVEN'T CHANGED THE GLOSSARY ENTRIES]
  				What we mean here is:  we get to choose which are executed 
  				depending on some conditions.
  				if the conditions are true execut the if body and if not the else body
				[DONE -- SMM]

======== WORKING THROUGH STILL
