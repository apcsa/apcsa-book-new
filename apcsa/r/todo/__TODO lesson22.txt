Need to add summary, exercises at end.
A good brainstorm in this last section would as 
  - Compare arrays and ArrayLists.  What are some advantages of each. 
    (note, arrays are -- more concise is about all they could get.)

 answers for arrays10.mc need to be corrected  (nate just made them up)!
 
 step6 could be a brainstorm, yo.
 
 
 
 change icons for lesson 12, 13
 
 need bluej projects for 12, 13, and everything else
 And solutions!
 
 need glossary entry for binary search, and/or some explanatory sentences refed in 13

 OLD STUFF
 
 // TODO by STEP NUMBER
s1 - VISUAL - right margin vocab line up with text. "Arrays"
s2 to s10 - VISUAL - boring!! add!

s3 - VISUAL - shrink code bounding box. (pre class)"Array initialization, method 1"
s6 - EDITORIAL - page & step title contains '(web java)'. "comparing intialization code (web java)"
s9 - EDITORIAL - page & step title contains '(web java)'. "A LineSegment class (web java)"
s10 - MC - Question & Answers missing! Need feedback too. "Playing with references to arrays"
s11 - MC need feedback. "Playing with references in arrays of objects"
s12 - VISUAL - shrink code bounding box.(pre class) "Common array-processing patterns"
s14 - EDITORIAL - page & step title contains '(web java)'. "Binary Search (webjava)"
s16 - VISUAL - center image. "ArrayList instance variables"

s21 - VISUAL - shrink code bounding box. (pre class) "Auto-expanding"
s22 - VISUAL = shrink code bounding box. (pre class) "Running java programs without bluej, revisited"

1)  answers for arrays10.mc need to be corrected  (nate just made them up)!
2) Project file step icons - vary them.
