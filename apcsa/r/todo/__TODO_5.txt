lesson 5 todo

- Lesson 5 Exercises - #1 : Grammar -- "sentence needs to be fixed : true if both are odd or both or even; otherwise, it returns false."
- Lesson 5 Exercises - #6c : Delete (DONE -- MJC)
- Lesson 5 Exercises -- Review answer key in teacher area

MJC modifications Sept 15 -- *lots* of additions
When run from the syllabus, clicking "Next" stops working at step 41
(the start of the Card steps).  The set of steps for the Cards used to be
unattached, and I moved it into the main sequence; this may have caused
some problems.

- ?cond41 -> turn into an fi, or two?  Or, bluej exercise?
   - note, not in the .project file, so ignore?
 

 
 - add Ketrina new images  (testing ifs, card outranks, boolean 5x, lots of good stuff!!)
  -- !!

- fix up the exercises page.
  
-- remove quizzes from summary
  -  DELETE?the quizzes were node_12 - 16 plus seq1, seq2 -- I think they can be deleted


=============== bluej projects

=== regular projects

- Card1: referenced in step43, step 46

- StringComp2: referenced in step35 "Comparison experiments" cond54-compexperiment.ht

- "Modifying the Name Class" = cond50-comparisonintro.ht -- step30
    points to lesson5/Names
    
    
=== bluej exercises

- "Classifying by age", cond38-selftest.ht -- step 11 
     points to lesson5/Age1


=== possible

  steps 5, 6 could be (although bluej exercises might be heavyweight...)

  step 18 -- thought this is analysis of source code.  
     could run it through tests to see if it is has bugs, and do a String comparison 
     to count how many "if" keywords they have... (better to count < and >)

  step 31 - Have students open Name project in step 37 not 31?
 
  step 46 -- outranks could be automatically tested, for sure, with a Card2 project

- ? add bluejexercise step after cond40.
  - asks students to do the same logic, shows nested ifs, has them fill in string assignments.
  
  - ?cond41 -> turn into an fi, or two?  Or, bluej exercise?
   - note, not in the .project file, so ignore?  
  
=== todo


   - what is node7.bluej?  clean this up:
   it shows the code in the step (too long), doesn't tell them to go to 
   bluej, etc...
  
=== orphans ?  integrate these?
 - cond41-selftestcocoa.html ,
      points to Cocoa1, which is fixed up

- "re comparison experiments" cond56-blankequality.html
     points to StringComp2
     could fit after step 36

  lesson5/temperature is unused?  needs fixing if it is to be used
   lesson5/StringComp1 is unused.  not fixed or anything...

 Step 35: BlueJ StringComp2 -- this isn't going to do what we want(s1 != s2 && s1.equals(s2) unless you change the constructor assignments to be 	
      s1 = new String(string1);
      s2 = new String(string2);

      -- I don't the students are ready to make that change yet
 

  
 ============= Mike addressed almost everything below. ====== 
  ======= Sean Morris - Summer 2010 ============
<<<<<<< .mine
 -  DELETE?the quizzes were node_12 - 16 plus seq1, seq2 -- I think they can be deleted
 - fix up the exercises page.
 - add a summary page !! -- Done
 - fix up unitquiz page, and add another - removed quizzes - SMM

       - The title bar persists between pages in both Chrome and Safari
         - Playing Cards as submenu does not look correct --> indent/change color?
        Step 3: Could break this into two pages
        Step 3/4: Practice Short-cuiting -- show truth table 
                  Short-circuiting Exercises at end   
      Step 6:  - The input box for BlueJ exercise is too tight
      Step 24: Brainstorm other options -- StringComp2/The source doesn't compile. 
        I fixed it but I am not doing something correctly.  
      Step 11: We probably need to show how to test the boundary?
               - BlueJ exercise on boundary cases
               - write test cases against buggy code
      Step 28 and Step 30 : They are modifying and testing the code directly now -- have we introduced? how?
      --> Summary
      --> End of Exercise Format 
      
      Teacher's Manual Note on Step 27
============  Sean Morris - DONE to FILE =========
      --> How about starting More on Booleans and Testing with Step 12 and Step 13
       --> Then do Testing and boudary cases and show tests? Step 10/Step 11
       Step 2ish : Short-circuiting and compound boolea ns
      Step 2: 
         - DONE The Java operator for "and" is &&  -- combiner (?)
         - DONE String capital?
      node_4.bs: Revisiting Name Class
             -- add line number --> This is not that easy to make it look right
             -- switch line number  
      Step 5: The student response is misleading becuase of short-circuiting - intended?
      Step 10 : DONE == Reworded the test cases number sets at bottom of page
      Step 10: It seems like the statement needs a context 
         -- How about putting the isLegalPercentage method as the context for Step 10 
    Step 10 : Boolean Variables and Methods -> Add variable example
      Step 13:DONE  Added more despcription to the checkerboard example
      Step 13: DONE Split into two pages -- one GradeBook and one Checkerboard and added an exmaple
               of an involation of the method that assigns to a boolean variable -- NOT sure about this part.
      Step 17 : DONE Code for Card Class -- added picture
      STEP 18: added optionally and the current object
      Step 19: Brainstorm : Filled out the example question asking to list test cases and modified the canned response
      Step 20: Added in instructions for opening up the Name class from lesson2/Names
      
      Step 21 : Added a bunch of detail, deleted the reference to refillable and used the Card class to object comparison.
      Step 24: I made instructions more explicit
      
      Step 29: fixed code formatting 
       Step 29: A little wierd becuase the code as it is would be create a semantic problem return first and middle 
        if you say the middle can be non-empty but the last empty 
             -- Add "+" sign
              -- add the canned responses that discuss possabilities
