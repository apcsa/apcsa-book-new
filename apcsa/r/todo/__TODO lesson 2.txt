//  Teachers manual TODO




// 

- Glossary needs executed defined (smm)

- Slide shows need fixed (Nate will do this). (nlm)

- Step 1 : A diagram of Source -> JVM -> byte code -> platform independence discussion? This can be fairly engaging when 
         students realize that you can program once and run anywhere; as well as this used to not be the case
		 - maybe in glossary  (smm)
		 
- Step #2: The configure BlueJ reference in the right menu bar is pointing to a non-existant entry in the glossary. This should probably point to instructions for configuration (ssm) (confirmed by nlm)
- Step #2: The configure BlueJ reference in the right menu bar is pointing to a non-existent entry in the glossary. This should probably point to instructions for configuration
						 
- Step #7: Glossary -- I haven't figured out where to edit but I would like to make some small changes -- hypens etc. (smm)


 - As you remove the last item from the list columns are shrinking --> make static width in css for these types of activities?
				 
- Step #9: The Glossary definition for void needs work		 				

Step 10: Why doesn't piece1 show up in the drop down box in blueJ method parameter dialog- SMM

         I don't know the answer to this question.  It may just be a BlueJ thing that we have no control over.
		 Nate?  Mike?  (nlm)
		 
Step 12 Per group discussion, add a glossary for integer some time in the future
- Step 26: comma around convention
           For class names that you would like to use two or more words
- Step 34 : method header or method signature           	
            - shrink spaces between bullet points (I don't know how to do this.)
            - method header glossary : header and signature are the same thing
		   (I don't see the problem here.  It says they are the same thing.)
- Step 36, Step 38: Sean verify this by calling the candyCount method on the object			 
- Step 42: Sean canned responses 2 more
- Step 43/Step 44: I like the metaphor of boxes for variables but we haven't introduced that before now -- maybe OK?
c
- Step 44: Step 2: Sean reword the : The result of adding in Step 1 is assigned to ...
	- Step 45: Put CandyJar in project open
           Add lightenbolt -- find the method signature, doubleCandy...
	 
 - At the end, the indenting is screwed up.
	 
General comments:		 
				 
A home button that links back to the syllabus would be nice.				 
		  
On the Match & Sequence would it be possible to have a reset button.
