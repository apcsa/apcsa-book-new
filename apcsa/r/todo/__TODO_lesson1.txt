// MUST FIX
   
	Step #28 :: didn't work in safari
	Step 35 -- reference to parameters premature?
	Step #36 :: punctuation in question
	Step #50 :: - What's the outcome - reword
	            - reword For example, a shoe in the real world doesn't tell us its size color, or style;
				- "names and types of parameters" -- know what parameters are 
	Step 53: In the little flash app, we invert row and column. I can show in person but just so people know.
	
	"Behaviors thus far" and "Interacting objects" have formatting problems.
	"Noticing similarities among behaviors" has a font problem.


// FIX IF THERE'S TIME
	- Add activity where students decide what would instance variables would be
	  appropriate for a particular class -- bad possabilities would be data values themselves as well 
	  possibly related but superfluous attributes like
	  type of glass for the VendingMachine
	   - a note on this should go into the teachers manual
	step3 -- turn to robot bubble talk

	step 8 - make it purty
	
	
	
	- More robot conversations would be good.  E.G., in order to summarize the 
	alarm clock stuff (before toasters)
	- Step 21 could use toaster robot
	
/// TEACHERS' MANUAL STUFF

   See above: in fix if there is time

	"interacting objects"
		- students can act out the interaction between clock and calendar
			
	"Classification of toaster behaviors"
		- possible tying in public/private stuff here
	
/// ALMOST DONE
	- model in the glossary
	- Step 2.5 How do model real-life?  --> determine behaviors and attributes of the object -- It seems we need a step
		introducing the process of modeling real-life
    - Step 3 Robot talk like Step 5
    - Step 6 Key Point on right about variable and then switches to behavior and state. 
    			- name and value both refer to variable in the glossary?
    - Step 9 I am struggling a bit with this one -- not to get rid of it but just wanting to write it down so I look again
	
/// DONE (MC)

	//// CANNED BS RESPONSES : added(need to verify)
	- a1s2c.bs "Other Alarm Clock Behaviors" (looks fine)
	- node_23.bs "Examples" (two responses)
	- 1.14.bs "Cell phone behaviors" (several responses)
	- node_0.bs "Producing a particular display" (flushed)
	- 3.11.bs "Representing the state of a toaster" (three responses)
	- 2.4.bs "Supplying some instances" (three responses)
	- 2.5.bs "Class vs instance" (three responses)
	- 3.2.bs "Alternative to Boolean info" (three responses)

	- 3.9.bs "Numeric representation of music volume" (four responses)
	- 3.10.bs "Representing max/min volumes with a string" (three responses)
	
	"The tick behavior" - 'sound the alarm' needs feedback!
	
	Step 2 (a2s3.html) - get vocab "model" in here somewhere...
	
	step 23  - don't say state here, say variables.   
		- basically, be consistent
		- clean up vocab issues between "variable", "state variable", and
		"instance variable" 
	
	step 16 - should we introduce booleans here?  general notion of types at all?
	No, we get to booleans and other types later.
	
	step 17 'classification of toaster behaviors' -- add feedback.

	Change the sequencing -- make more sub sequences, etc.  Right now, each 
	group has too many steps...  
	   - for instance, break before toasters in step 15
	break the sequence around 19, where we start parameters
	
	Lesson 1 really needs a summary -- in a final sequence at the end.
	
	[NOT DONE since no clue what's desired] 
	break step 20 into 4 steps.   make last redquote a talkbubble
			
	[NOT DONE since no clue what's desired] 
	step 12 - make prompt a little more verbose
	I don't know what step is referred to here--it's not step 12.
	
	[NOT DONE since no clue what's desired] 
	step 19 - formatting wackiness
			- should go in teacher manual as possible classroom activity...
	
	we should model two different objects that interact; a vending machine
	might work for this [I did it with the clock and calendar instead]
	
	move "section wrap ups" into a final "summary", and delete them
	
	Summary is too long.
	
	add a brainstorm (after step 15) which asks whether 'pop up' and 
	'stop toasting' can be combined.
	One canned resp: 'my toaster pops up but still is glowing'...
	
	Homework, further problems, etc...
	
	I think I dealt with these.
		the goal of lesson 1 are to model some real-world thing with state and behaviors
		*   behaviors can be conditional
		*   there are patterns of interaction between state and behaviors
		*   behaviors can be either externally actived or internally activated
		*   what level of abstraction is our model at?
		
		do we want to say anything more about parameters?
	
	I decided not to do this.
		request - add a step after to have them work with possible behaviors,
				 perhaps a list of 'good' and 'bad' ones that they can categorize?
		response
		*	right after "Level of modeling detail": multiple choice that asks
			which of the following might be reasonable additions to the clock
			model
				whether or not the clock face glows in the dark (not reasonable)
				whether or not Roman numerals appear on the clock face (not)
				whether or not military time appears on the face
			this seems a bit lame
	
	
	step 24 -- move to homework.
	step 25/26 -- move to homework.

	//// MATCHING SEQUENCES : added some kind of feedback ("Try Again" or "Correct")
	//// Need to verify.
	- 1.13.ms "Matching Challenge" (flushed)
	- "Fractional Candy?" -- only has 1 response (I think this is for lesson 2)
	* Why is the feedback to a wrong answer Fantastico???!! see step 27.
	
   Fixed gameboard simulator -- everything is 0 based, dropdown lists are updated, etc.
