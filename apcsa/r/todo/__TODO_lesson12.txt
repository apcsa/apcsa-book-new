Lesson 12
BLUEJ Steps:
- Draw1
- Card1
- Card2
- Card3
- Card4
- Card5

=====================
STEPS:
NATE - s1 - VISUAL - need splash graphic "Collections" -  
NATE  - Step 20, where a while loop is rewritten as a for loop, isn't ideal.
    really, they should recode a find-element pattern and use a break, but currently
    they don't.  This could be done, however, with the while loop in runRace, but it 
    would involve changing that while loop to use a break in the first place.



=======

Done:

NATE - step 12.9 --   - add dot racing as a project here?  make it buggy?  Have them fill it in?
[MIKE fixed] Step 4: 
	- I might explain the nested construction of a Name object in the add method
	- Add Step for Index Out of Range illustrating an index of -1 and size() or greater
[MIKE: I killed this step. ]  SEAN  - make 'arraylistRefillable' project
[MIKE -- I worked on this.]  Exercises need some work
[MIKE: done.] Summary
s8 - VISUAL - Edit code to fit frame & divide into 2 parts. "Program to save mouse clicks"
EDIT -- &dash; --> need to be subtract [MIKE: fixed]
		 EDIT -- bottomCards is crossed out [MIKE: fixed]
MIKE - Move these to lesson 14
MIKE - Perfect shuffle is already (re)covered in lesson 14.
Step 28: 
		 BLUEJ - Card5 is not setup
Step 6: NATE -- swtich to multiple choice (say put name into arraylist<string> - one choice, toString() gets called.
Step 7: No MC questions		
Step 8: BlueJ - framework for setting up arraylist
[MIKE: current step 10 needs code location.]
Step 11/12: BlueJ
   MIKE: we thought three stages:
       stage 1 -- polygon that never closes, what is given.  has pattern1.
       stage 2 -- write closing (checks first element in list)
       stage 3 -- write no clicks on existing points (uses pattern2)
[MIKE: I did stage 1 and a variation of stage 3]       
       stage 4 (later?) -- draw line between every pair of points (nested loops)
Step 15: Show the declaration of the ArrayLists in each example
Step 13:  I might throw an illustrated example like Step 15's here - just to have a visual Or maybe one of the cartoons?
s18 - BS need feedback. "while vs for loops"
Step 19 : - Last paragraph example uses arrays [MIKE: not any more]
		  - EDIT = =we discourage ++ or -- anywhere but on a line
	Step 22: EDIT :: declare int k = 0;
		 - They would need two lines -- is it misleading to put one line
		 	if(myCards.get(k).suit() != myCards.get(k+1).suit())
			 				return false;
		- Tell them to open project -- Card1
		- BLUEJ -- Card1 - ArrayList is not initialized	  - Do we show x += 1 type later?
Step 23:- EDIT "process every element" instead of "process every elements"
		- Needs more than one line in the code example
		- Add comments to BlueJ Hand class
		- BLUEJ -- Card2 - ArrayList is not initialized
						 - The first line of code needs : int k = myCards.get(0).suit();
						 - what exactly do we want here?
[MIKE: class name Hand needs to be <tt> in step #24]
Step 26: Change to MC?
[MIKE: in step #29, the second bullet needs to be split.]
NATHAN - Step 8.5, 8.6 (or later): Drag questions to have them test knowledge of list operations. 
Step 30/31 in Summary are empty
NATE -- FIX ALL THE CARD CLASSES, MOVE FROM LESSON 14, FIX HAND (build the array list)
Step 20 : Should we introduce the Hand class as well?
						 
Step 24: Card3	 --> does the nested loop explanation need more work -- seperate step maybe?
				 --> instantiate ArrayList

Step 27: BLUEJ -- Card4 -- instantiate and fill Hand
						-- put in order to begin with
