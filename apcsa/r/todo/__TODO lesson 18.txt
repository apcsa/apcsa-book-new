====== SOMEDAY



- add some more assessments at end of intro sequence
- discuss scanner at some point, you yahoo

-- talk about how inheritance works in command /inputgather class.

-- add canned responses to room6.bs

-- ITEMS, ITEMS, ITEMS!!!

  - v1 framework, lots and lots of stuff
	  - item	
     - command
     - player
  - first item, an ipod
  - specialize so gives a different description each time it prints it
    (random select from songs its playing).
  - items that can't be taken
  - integrate room and item -- key and fridge

 - could have a "ItemHolder" interface that both Player and Room 
   implement -- addItem, removeItem(String name).  But, you want
   this to mean you don't have to write those methods in both
   classes, and with interface you still do.  Does the interface
   buy you anything?
     - could do inheritance...
