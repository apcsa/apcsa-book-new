Lesson 6

==== bluej exercises 

 we should add lesson5/cocoa1 to this lesson (unused in lesson 5).

SMM - 10/25/2010
- I might just quickly teach the Thread.sleep(); this gives them a lot more to do with the project. I had one student -- Clio Heard -- pull it off. It was cool.
- I might also at least provide some instructions on creating their own image -- it could be on help page even. I had a number of students try but only one able to make it work right.



---------------------------- OLD -------------------


==== MUST BE DONE
BlueJ and VirtualPet
 - Can the editor be given line numbers?
 - VirtualPet not set up as a BlueJ exercise -- no Test and Reset buttons in editor
 - VirtualPet doesn't not have access specifiers on instance variables
 - no arrow between classes showing composition in BlueJ
 - VirtualPet v2 all code for student to write is in file.
 - It looks like code is correct in the methods the mc for step 10 indicates that hunger is not being set
 
Help Giude: 
 - Opening blueJ --> Quotes on menu items
  				  --> refers to extension as if it needs to be downloaded? 

Glossary:
- argument  - mixing up parameters and arguments in definition -- show example


VLE: 
- Fill-in Problems:  Side bar doesn't extend entire length (reference Lesson 6 02review - Step 2:)

Lessons:
- Manage Sequence is not in lesson -- out on purpose 0- looks like not complete yet
- 01intro  - Step 1: - Talk Bubble ul is bold -- couldn't get it off
- 10hunger - Step 10 : Answer is not right -- at least not for my code -- does the code revert to some buggy version
- 13hunger2 - Step 13: Do lead them toward writing a checkDead method?
- write_4 - Step 22: -  Reference http://localhost/~seanmorris/apcsa/view.php?location=3: Step 51 - can we do that?
- check GLossary constructor change	
- Glossary - String should be capitalized SVN freaking on me	
   

=== MUST BE DONE WEBJAVA


==== SHOULD BE DONE, IF THERE IS TIME


- (NATE) write hte "manage complexity" activities for day 2.  Some are there already
    (seq3, which is not included right now).
    - functional abstraction (methods to categorize hunger, rather than
          tests everywhere).
    - adding helper methods to check for iniital situations, rather than
        doing tests on instance variables at the top of each public
        method.  
    - including a test class (?)
  (NATE) include examples of "bad" code (tight coupling, perhaps) and work through
      fixes.
  













=====  WOULD BE NICE SOMEDAY



===== DONE

- 02review - Step 2: - The fill-in questions type is not parsing html
- 03pet - Step 3: -  picture missing
- 04open - Step 4:  - I get two classes in Blue - VirtualPet and VirtualPetFace - add to instructions
- 07explore3 - Step 7 :- andsleep, theVirtual, theface, methodsset - space
						- Captial S on string
						- everything in <tt>
						-  Add in questions?  Where is the VirtualPetFace instantied?
-  08explore4 - Step 8: We'll look more closely at how hunger is effected in each method in a bit.
- 12hunger1 - Step 12: move Try It to Step 13
- 11fill - Step 11: Fill-in not parsing 
				 so that the code looks right:

        		public void feed ( ) {
        			   hunger = hunger - 10;
        			   if (               ) {
                			____#1_______
              			hunger = 0; }
           				face.setMessage('Yum, thanks');
          				 face.setImage('normal'); 
        		} 
- 16squash - Step 16: - File Menu's itialics
					  - Two Inspecting an object one on the help and one in the glossary
					  - You'll need to make sure you check the following:
					  
					       
- 17petbrainstorm - Step 17: - Rewrite - Name two or three moods you would add to VP. Describe the moods and methods we need to add to our class
										our class.
										
- write_1 - Step 18 : state variables to instance variables
- write_3 - Step 20 : Note -- grammar - comma and period

- write_3b - Step 21: though -> thought
- write_4 - Step 22:- thuroughly

Glossary:
- constructor -- no return type instead of type -- they don't return data
			 -- or the same number of parameters but types in different orders
			 -- add examples of different constructors
			 
- string 	- double quotation mark
		  	- enclosed in quotation marks
			- Add Do you see the 10 characters -- make sure to add the space
			- Should it be capitalized?
