==== TODO

 - should add an undo method to framework code.  need 2 more images
 (each 3 arrays) (prev_red),
 and swap them within refresh().   ?


  - write flip horizontal, using flipvetical as a guide.

  - help with contrast stretching math -- do as double and cast to int, etc.

  - median filtering (to remove dust, noise, etc)
     - need to give them a noisy image first.  noiseify one of the existing
     images.




  - spatial filtering 
     - smoothing
     - sharpening
     - edge detection
     
     - itegrate images
  - median filtering/blurring (robot with glasses)

     
     

     
====== SOMEDAY

     exercise ideas:
   -  swtich red/blue/green around.
   -  make negative image (only one color)

     


add example images to the exercises (i.e., what they are supposed to do)


rgb illumination from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RGB_illumination.jpg

- tell about refresh earlier

walk them through flipvertical.  have them change it, see what happens
,etc (switch only one color).

 - fix up last two sequences, make less didactic eh




  - make 3D image (shift one color).  whoa, cool.
     -  make an image 3d.   need multiple images, composing them,
     and shifting each slightly farther in the background...
     - use cyan (equal blue and green), so only two channels.
     if red/blue glasses, then just remove green channel altogether

  - composing images
     - greenscreen?
