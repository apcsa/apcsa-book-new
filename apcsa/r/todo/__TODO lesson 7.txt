LESSON 7 TODO


========= BlueJ exercises:
Greeting2 ==
  1. Rename it -- has nothing to do with Greeting -> about rectangle drawing
  2. newDrawRect -- either should take the Graphics object or I guess set instance variable

========= Would be nice and Larger Questions:


========= To Be Done

Steps:
- Step 11 : The glossary entry for "callback method" is awkwardly worded and confusing. 


- Step #11 (Callbacks) 
	The glossary entry for "callback method" is awkwardly worded and confusing. 
- Step #24 and #23 -- I think should be switched -- The constructor is easier (DONE MJC)
- Step #25 --  I am not seeng the difference between #23 and #25?
	(MJC--they're sort of inverses; 
	 see apcsa/__REMOVE_teacher_info__put_in_moodle/assessments/Exercises
	 Is this the right place for these?)
- I suggest moving #28 to after #20 -- do theresizing piece right after the 
	outlining of Hi There in #20 (DONE MJC)
- The grpahics_methods page is not on the production server
- Step 29 : safeDrawRect is good -- I would add instructions to make sure they reset the myWindowWidth and myWindowHeight
 			painComponent by call getSize().

- Steps 25/26 : newDrawRect and newDrawRect2 -- need more description related to passing the Graphics object
											 -- maybe a copy of the code on the page

- Just to note, show students how to find .java file

=======
 			(MJC ??? I don't understand)
============  DONE
- The grpahics_methods page is not on the production server

- Step 3 Glossary Java library -- should this be changed to 1.6?
- Step #32 (Drawing a bull's eye) 
	"Suppose the drawing color is black." What difference does the drawing color 
	make to the answer? It requires 5 ovals, the first one red, the next one black, etc. â€“ 
	unless I am missing something here. 

[SMM DONE]
- Ignored this one Step 7: We switch to saying Greeting class which acts like a JPanel - 
		maybe introduce this "acts like" earlier?

- Step 9 : glossary - work on definition of parameter -- placeholder in method signature 
							located between parentheses
- Step 25/26/27: Maybe we wrap anything that asks students to code in special colored box or just BlueJ box
- Step 26: BlueJ box asking to open lesson7/Greetings2

- Step 5 : Spelling: Glossary : inheritance -- first line relationship spelled wrong
			I would add non-private instance variables and methods

- Step 4: Spelling : pre-written, are: [MJC: I can't find an error mentioning "pre-written" or "are".]

- Looks fixed -- Greetings2 not working -- asks students to type in code but can't
- Made into template Olympic Rings is in the programs section -- should it be moved to teacher answers?
- Done sm ColorfulShapes project is not working -- I am not sure if this was meant for exercises
- Looks done - Should cajole the user to open and run greeting before the analysis. 
  This means moving step 14 -- maybe not 


[MJC fixes]
- Step 4: Spelling : theJPanel towards bottom
- Step 5: metaphor of flyHigh and writeCode is good but may need more? [MJC: I think
		we decided against this]
- Step 6: Match sequence --  [MJC: Check my replacement]
			- "used at top of your program" twice
			- this piece needs work -- intro statement about what to do,
			- "used when you define a class" -- this could be both
- Step 9: Spelling: Put the g parameter in quotes or something
- Step 10: link back this discussion to triggers in lesson 1 -- Calendar and clock
- Step 14: Spelling: extendsand  and GReetingsclass
- Step 15: THe MC answers needs feedback
- Step 18/19 : feedback on MC
- Step 17: Spelling: closing <li> -- two semicolons in end of paintcomponent
- Step 21: No picture to mimic
- Step 22: MC : Need code
- Step 23: MC : Need feedback and the answer doesn't seem correct. [MJC: I got rid
			- of the negative arguments steps]
- Step 24: MC : Need answers [MJC: vanished with step 23]
- Step 28: 	- Spelling: thisJPanel
- Step 30:  - Spelling : last line says getColor method, ..., method -- delete second mention
- Step 28: 	- Should we explain getSize().width -- will that get what they are doing?
			- A brainstorm on what the access specifier of width must be?
- Step 30:  - put actual paintComponent method using Graphics object to call setColor.
- Step 31:  - MC feedback
- Step 32:  - MC feedback
- Step 35: Spelling : Turtle Graphics question turtle misspelled just before "forward"
- Step 35: - second box of bullet points indents the last too far
				 - maybe define turnleft and turnright same time					
- Summary needed

- It might opportunity to fill out the step on "getSize().width" and create 
  a series of activites that force them to think about what it means when 
  a method returns an object reference like in getSize() and why you can call 
  another method/instance variable(!) on that object [MJC: Done]
- we might also think about putting more in on why you can see methods from JPanel 
  when you use the Greeting Object [MJC: I think we decided not to do this]
