General:
========
- Possible steps:
	- we could lead them through a unit testing scenario where we set up the 
		unit tests
	- each step explores each what each helper method should accomplish
- I copied over the two elevens steps from Lesson 12 - cards5 and node_8 -- they are not in yet
- I committed a solution in the teacher area as well a template in
	the student area.
- The student version has everything implemented but: 
		- play
		- removeJQK
		- removeSum11
		- simulate -
- Possible Class Structure:
	Card class:
		- standard -- wth outranks
	Deck Class
		- resetDeck
		- shuffle
		- dealTopCard
		- numCardsLeftInDeck
	Elevens Class
		- Deck field
		- onTable ArrayList field -- this could be separate class?
		- play
		- removeJQK
		- removeSum11
		- sortOnTable <-- if you sort the cards on the table 
							then easier to remove JQK or Sum11
		- simulate -

Issues :
	- both play and simulate need nested loops
	- rank in the Card class is stored 0-based so you must had one to rank before
		checking sums
	- removing the cards from OnTable in removeJQK and removeSum11 needs 
		to consider that the indexes 
		all reduce by one whenever you remove an element 
	- you need to remember to reset and shuffle the deck, as well empty
		the arraylist of the cards on the table everytime you call play
