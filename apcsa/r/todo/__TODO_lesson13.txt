Lesson 13 To Do
==============
BlueJ:
- Can we add a method to pick another sound to Sound class
- I put a solution to all the methods -- I don't think my normalize nor my addNoise is correct
- old todo - NATE - make sure the wav files are 22050, etc, in /sounds
===============
Steps:
s1 - VISUAL - maybe add a step w/ some splash graphic. "Introduction" - it looks like one is there?
Step 2 :  - VISUAL - add some image / speech bubble
s3 - VISUAL - image of amplitude and frequency -- can we find better?

Summary
Exercises

================
OLDER To do: SMM notes on this -- 11/2010
3) exercise_0.html. add table of note->hertz -
refers Steps 9-10 : looks fine to me? 6) intro_6.html needs serious Look and Feel help!!!  multiple pages? 
       slideshow?  Can't really get rid of the vocab word...(ML)
7) more in intro, or somewhere, about writing another
    class as a script class, to quickly rebuild objects. -- [SMM] Not sure what refers too
8) more exercises 
       -- drum machine (need samples). -- [SMM] would be good but there is enough to go on
       ?
9) make sounds - [SMM] not sure what this is
   - square wave
   - triangle wave
   - sin wav

10) advanced: -- [SMM - More exercises?]
    filter out pops ?
    add two sounds together, making a ratio of how much 
      to attenuate
    echo/delay/reverb
    Detect the end of a song, or words, etc  
    
11) intro_4b.html, giving metaphor about speaker cone position?  -- [SMM] not sure what refers too and 4b is gone
                  messiness of sound?

==============
DONE 
-  Amplitude needs glossary entry
Step 4: - Needs 2nd graphic
        - needs feedback and answer defined
Step 5: - Needs graphic
        - needs feedback and answer defined
Step 6: EDIT : rate of 22050 ==> comma in number

Step 7: EDIT : one of the feedbacks -- rate of 22050 samples
Step 15: - bluej icon
Step 13: BS -- needs canned responses
Step 16  - bluej icom
		 - EDIT - Many different ways can work. --> Many different values can work
		 - EDIT _ you you might want to add --> you might want to add
		 - EDIT - bullet or lightening icon the tasks
		 
Step 18: BS -- needs canned responses
			-- the BS icon is different - haven't seen before
			Step 14: EDIT - extra space between numbers in blue square
			  - bluej icon - lightbulb on step
		 -NOT HERE We might want to explore how to initialize max and min 
		 		int max = 0; ==> where could this go wrong?
		 		what is a better way
		 		int max = myData.get(0);
		 - For normalize, does it matter what you pick max or min -- what is the effect? Pick the greatest?
		 - tell them don't forget to cast when you multiply
		 
Step 12: Change to BlueJ lightbulb icon to make look like BlueJ step
		-  we need to explore casting:  myData.set(i, (int) (myData.get(i) * amt));
- Can we add method to restore original sound?
- No parameter constructor works correctly but the one parameter String filename causes NPE error on 
	line 739 of Viewer class
- Change file opener to get straight to Sound/sounds
