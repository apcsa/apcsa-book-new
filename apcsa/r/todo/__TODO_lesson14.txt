Todo LESSON 14

General --
- I might add steps that force them to predict the state of the list
  in the next step of either sort
- Can we point them to animations to see how they work
- Diagrams would be good too.
=====================
BlueJ:
- suitSize is not in Deck do we add or delete one parameter constructor from Card

========================
Steps (step numbers have been updated in this section):

Step 4: - needs feedback
Step 15: - BlueJ icon
		 - Do outranks first -- maybe seperate steps (DONE MJC)
		 - we are dscribing in line(in place?) selection sort? Should we make that clearer?
		 	-> One way to sort is to build the sorted list from the end.
		 - Can we point to an animation? Or create one our selves?
Step 16: - BlueJ icon
		 - "Choose the first element? "  Animation?
Step 24: think about replacement since current version is both hard and long
Step 25: Needs code or a reference to a BlueJ activity
Step 27: do everything in spades?
Step 28: include a choice with clubs
Step 31: Sherry response is incompatible with sort by name; do we want sort by hand?

Add color?
Use collections.sort?
Make sure glossary entries are provided.
Advertise Sort Detective.

============
Done:
Add a debugging step.

Step 2: - Add BlueJ Icon
		- Add in which integers map to which suit
Step 3: Get rid of bluej box
Step 4: BS Canned Responses
Step 5: EDIT -- extra parentheses by For
		- Do we push them to make a chart?
		s7 - VISUAL - add a space between paragraph and table. "A perfect shuffle"
s8 - VISUAL - plain. add img. "Two approaches to random shuffling"

Step 9: - BS canned reponses 
		- This line needs to change to : int temp = myCards.get(r1); --> Card temp = myCards.get(r1);
		- why are we setting this up to terminate on break? - for loop ?
		- turn into BlueJ project -- make more explicit to try it -- DIDN't do


Step 10/11: I think this needs some more work -- I having to read it pretty intensely
s10 - VISUAL - Content about "<->" arrows are hard to read. "Analysis by hand"
s11 - BS need feedback. "Evaluating the exchange-based shuffle"


Step 14: Canned responses
Step 15: Canned responses
Step 17 refers to Hand class? Means Deck?
Step 17: Correct spelling of "choosen"; also use myCards for consistency with sorting stuff
Step 18: Needs code or a reference to a BlueJ activity
Step 18: Canned responses
			- refers to Hand class
Step 19: Canned response
			- refers to Hand class
Step 22: Needs code or a reference to a BlueJ activity
Step 24: "1b" => "2b"; 
Step 26: say "choose ... from the start of the list"
Step 28: "is" => "could be"
Step 40: missing paren

 s16 to s17 - VISUAL - plain. need img!
