Any steps : add board related pic from earlier lessons


NOTE: students show trouble using Color -- they'll write
   function blah (Color.c, String name, ...)
 and other issues.  Problem with static?
 
 Also, studnets are really seeing "main" for the first time in gridworld.  Maybe a page on this?


It would be nice to tell students how to make new images for the bugs
   (put a BugClass.gif file in the same location as BugClass.java file, with the name of the gif
    exactly the same as the name of the class.)
    
Get latest gridworld code into projects in repo



We need exam level questions.  PErhaps the right thing to do is move 1/2 of week 3 
earlier, and then add exam-level questions into 3.  See the todo for lesson 28, which has a link to 
collegeboard supplied questions.


Write up something in teachers manual about our experiences with differences between dates in CS3.  That is, 
nobody reads this unless they get checked on their answers to questions probing their understanding.
