lesson 9 todo
-------------

MJC: I just added brainstorm requests.

NATENATNETNATANANTENATENAET does this, or assigns it.

BlueJ:
WhileExample_1 - Step 7 --> Change comment "Make one change to one line" --> "Change exactly one line"
String1 - Step 13 - BlueJExercise needs to be fixed doesn't work
String2 - Step 14 - BlueJExercise needs to be fixed doesn't work
String3 - Step 15 - BlueJExercise needs to be fixed doesn't work
Singer1 - Step 16
Year1 - Step 18
Digits1 - Step 19
Digits2 - Step 20
Digits3 - Step 21
Date1 - Step 23
NumberGuesser - step 33 -- click ignored errors
GusserBuggy = Step 35 -- won't allow me to set breakpoints?
BlanksRemoved - Step 43: needs work
Add another buggy method - step 44:

=========
Steps: 
Step 22: Make Brainstorm with bad code
Step 32: turn into a multiple choice
Step 33: maybe more descpition about what it should do
Step 36: picture missing
Step 37: picture missing
Step 44: Instruct to open new project and make method work



=======

DONE SMM 10/2010=====

Step 2: Text Edit: "the statement following the while loop body"
Step 7: Text Edit : "Make one change to one line"  --> "Change exactly one line"
		Text Edit : "in the earlier" --> "in WhileExample_1"
Step 9: In code, actually comment out line a = a + 1
Step 10: Can we not use a "b" as method name?
Step 38: Fill out intro a bit "Describe the bug you found in the previous step


==== MUST BE DONE

- canned responses for node_(1-10).bs

- string_3 are pitifully short.  How about we get 
  Ketrina to add some art?  This is probably true for several 
  of the bluej steps.
   
  
- (NATE) turn debug_5.html into a BlueJ node, link it to a bluej
  project that mike sends me (with Contains1More method).  Fix up
  the html to explain what the method is supposed to do.

- (MIKE) deal with hw_2, hw_3, hw_4, and hw_5.html. 
  Either flesh out or remove.


 
==== SHOULD BE DONE, IF THERE IS TIME

- break while_stmt_1.html into 2 pages.  introduce code after first ul
    - no need for flow chart stuff
    - basically, slow it down
- infinite loops (while_stmt_8 needs way more time spent)

- put link to earlier step in while_stmt_9.  Never knew how to do that...

- string_2.html needs additional stuff (or better on another page)
  on roles of variables...

-Adding the div to blueJ exercises 

=== WOULD BE NICE SOMEDAY
- The ability to talk about pointers in curriculum :)








---- OLDER 

s1 - can be broken down into 2 pages (intro should look short and sweet)
s5 - BS need feedback "The count variable"
s6 - BS need feedback "Statement orders"
s12 - Style code to look different from comments (use the comment class tag with span)
s18 - 22 : boring!!! no graphic or talk bubbles at all.
s24 - BS need feedback. "Introduce a bug"
s28 - BS need feedback. "Run-counting"
s30 - BS need feedback. "Guess the number"
s31 - Seems like this should be a BS or OR
s32 - Title needs fixing on html file and proj file. "web java9"
s36 - First picture doesn't load?
s37 - BS question has no context. Need feedback. "The bug(1)"
s38 - BS question has no context. Need feedback. "The bug(2)"
s40 - BS need feedback. should provide a link to previous step to look at code.
      "The wrong answer"
s41 - BS need feedback. should provide a link to previous step to look at code.
      "Incorrect results"
s42 - Looks to be a bluej node.
s43 - Looks to be a bluej node.
s39 - 43: section Debugging: lack of interesting graphics/ talk bubbles.
s45 - Lack content. "Playing NIM"
s47 - Lack content. "Roman Numerals"
