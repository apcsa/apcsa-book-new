            How does abstraction help us program? 
            Among other things, it makes <span class="vocab">reuse</span>
            of program code easier, saving us time.
            A more general class that works for all the situations we've seen&mdash;candy jars, refrigerators
            filled with Coca Cola&#0153;, and a game player's score&mdash;could be used for all three of these applications.

            Abstractions deal with general descriptions, not specific ones.

            Correctly using abstraction can help you see things that you might 
            otherwise miss.  Consider the phrase "missing the forest for the trees", which  
            refers to the unfortunate act of getting stuck thinking about details, 
            and missing the big picture.  Abstractions can help 
            programmers understand the big picture.

                Abstraction is the process of noticing similarities
                in examples and identifying the pattern that all the examples fit.
