<p>
You've had some practice in previous activities with choosing names for variables and methods.
Ideally, names should contribute toward making the program as readable to others (and yourself!) as easy as possible.
In programs we're provided so far, we follow the following conventions:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
   <td> </td>
   <td align="center"><i>name</i></td>
   <td align="center"><i>examples</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><tt>void</tt> methods</td>
   <td align="center">an imperative verb&mdash;<br>a command&mdash;<br> or verb phrase</td>
   <td align="center"><tt>refill</tt>,<br><tt>useUp</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>typed methods</td>
   <td align="center">noun</td>
   <td align="center"><tt>currentAmount</tt>,<br><tt>averageUse</tt>, <tt>lastFirst</tt>,<br><tt>fullName</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In the next couple of lessons, we will encounter <i>Boolean</i> methods, which we name somewhat differently.
