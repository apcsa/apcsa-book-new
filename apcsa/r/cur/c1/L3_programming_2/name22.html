<p>Use the <span class="help">string_methods</span> link to the right for a summary review of the commonly used String methods.</p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="name22_1">
            <p>Write the <tt>initials</tt> method (suitable for
               keeping track of scores in a video game).<tt>initials</tt> should return the result of 
               concatenating the first letters of <tt>myFirst</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>myMiddle</tt>, and <tt>myLast</tt>.</p>
         </li>

            <p audio="name22_2">Write a <tt>nickname</tt> method that returns the
               first initial of the first name followed by the first 
               half of the last name. For example, if <tt>s</tt> represents the name Jennifer Lynn Lopez,&nbsp;<tt>s.nickname
                  ( )</tt> should return <tt>"JLo"</tt>.</p>

               inserting, or deleting) a single character in the&nbsp;<tt>Name</tt> class, with the result that after a

            <p audio="name22_5">In the game of Hangman, someone guesses letters in a
               word until he/she guesses the word or runs out of
               guesses. A program that allows a user to play the game
               maintains two strings as internal state: the word to be
               guessed, and the string to be shown to the 
               user&mdash;we'll call it <tt>userString</tt>&mdash;with
               underline characters that represent letters that the
               user hasn't yet guessed. Write a method named&nbsp;<tt>update</tt> that, given a letter that occurs
               exactly once in the secret word, updates&nbsp;<tt>userString</tt> to replace the corresponding
               underline character with the correctly guessed
               character.</p>
             <pre>    public class Hangman{
       private String wordToBeGuessed;
       private String userString;

       //... lots of other code <br>
       // Write the update method<br>
       public void update(String letterGuessed){

<p>
What is the decimal representation of the value represented in binary as 1001010?

<p>
What is the binary representation of the value represented in decimal as 37?

Consider the method below, intended to exchange the values of its arguments.
</p>
<pre>
void exchange (int a, int b) {
   int temp = a;
   a = b;
   b = temp;
}
</pre>
<p>
When called from a tester class, it doesn't work:
</p>
<pre>
  int x = 3;
  int w;
  w = 30;
  exchange (x, w);
  System.out.println ("x = " + x + "  w = " + w);
</pre>
<p>
Intended output:  <tt>x = 30  w = 3</tt> </br>
Actual output:  <tt>x = 3  w = 30</tt>
</p>
<p>
Explain what went wrong.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Would the <tt>exchange</tt> method have worked if the arguments were <tt>String</tt> objects?
Briefly explain why or why not.
