            So far, we've thought about how things in the real world 
            have certain features that we will use to help us design  
            computer programs.  In the last activities, we focused 
            on a jar of candy and the <tt>CandyJar</tt>
            program.
        </p>
       
        <p audio="refillable0_2">
            As we thought more about what features a jar of candy might 
            have, and more about what sorts of new features a computer  
            representation might have (e.g., <tt>averageUse</tt>), we 
            modified our original <tt>CandyJar</tt>
            class. 
            In this lesson, we are going to take this process farther,  
            and look at very different kinds of things in the real world.

                Without ruining the punchline, you will start to see how 
                real-world objects that are obviously quite different can  
                be represented by very similar Java classes.

                This "finding 
                what is the same" is a <i>very</i>
                important part of being
                a good programmer.
