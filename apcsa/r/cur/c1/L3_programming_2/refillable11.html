            about how it is used. 
            For instance, she might want to keep track of how much of the contents is

            In the next few steps, we will expand the <tt>Refillable</tt> class by 
            adding a method named <tt>averageUse</tt> that returns the average amount used per call to the <tt>useUp</tt> method.
