<p>Let's look at what happens when we call the <tt>Name</tt> constructor with argument strings "Grace", "Murray", and "Hopper".
The diagram below shows three boxes for the arguments and three more for the instance variables.

<p>
When the first assignment in the constructor is executed, we copy the contents of <tt>first</tt>&mdash;an arrow, not a sequence of characters&mdash;into the box representing <tt>myFirst</tt>.
The result is shown below.

<p>
The second and third arguments are similarly copied into <tt>myMiddle</tt> and <tt>myLast</tt>:

<p>
Now we call <tt>fixCase</tt>.
It has a parameter <tt>namePart</tt> that is represented by another box:
</p>

<p>
The argument <tt>myFirst</tt>&mdash;another arrow!&mdash;is copied into <tt>namePart</tt>. We now have three boxes that contain an arrow pointing at "Grace": one is the parameter to the constructor, another is the instance variable <tt>myFirst</tt>, and the third is the parameter <tt>namePart</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Now the two assignment statements in <tt>fixCase</tt> are executed.
After the first assignment to <tt>namePart</tt>, we have

After the second assignment:

The main thing to note from this example is that only arrows are copied, and any changes to one variable don't affect the contents of any other.
