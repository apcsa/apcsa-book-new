 We could have chosen different method names for the

 <tt>Refillable</tt>. Consider the name

 <tt>useUp</tt>, the name of the method that

 reduces the amount (of something) in the refillable object.

 <br />

 <br />

 For each of the following, briefly explain how it compares

 with the name "useUp".

 <ul>

 <li audio="2">decrease</li>

 <li audio="3">consume</li>

 <li audio="4">reduce</li>

 </ul>

    <div class="canned-responses">
        
        <div name="Hana">- decrease: I think the word decrease doesn't indicate that the amount of something is being used up. For example, decrease is perfectly fine for the recording scores, but it doesn't really make sense if decrease is used to represent the drink method.

- consume: I think it demonstrates useUp well, but opposite of 'decrease', it might not make sense if we are talking about the cokeCooler class. If consume is used in the cokeCooler class, does that mean the cokeCooler drank the coke? (!!!)

- reduce: I think it's the same with 'decrease'.
