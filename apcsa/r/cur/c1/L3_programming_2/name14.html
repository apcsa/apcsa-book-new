      <p audio="name14_1">Apparently the calls to <tt>fixCase</tt> had no effect.</p>
      <p audio="name14_2">The reason has to do with how an argument is supplied to a method.
         We mentioned earlier that a good way to think of a variable is as a box. 
         When a method is called, a new box is set up inside the method for each parameter; 
         the corresponding argument box is <em>copied</em> into the method's box, 
         and the latter is used within the method. </p>
