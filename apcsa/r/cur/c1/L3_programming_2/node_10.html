<p>
So far, you've tested your programs by instantiating an object&mdash;thereby
adding the object to the Object Bench&mdash;then control-clicking on the object 
to select a method.
A somewhat more convenient way to test a program is to define a 
<span class="vocab">tester class</span>.
This approach exchanges mouse clicking for typing,
but requires less work when a program is being modified repeatedly
and run with the same set of tests.
</p>
<p>
One way to organize a tester class is to have its constructor
make calls to the methods of the class being tested.
Here, for example, is a tester class for the original version
of <tt>Refillable</tt>, available online as <tt>lesson3/RefillableTester</tt>.

<pre>
public class Tester {

   public Tester ( ) {
      Refillable rtest = new Refillable (100);
      rtest.useUp (10);
      System.out.println ("current contents = " 
                          + rtest.currentAmount ( )
                          + "; should be 90");
      rtest.useUp (20);
      System.out.println ("current contents = " 
                          + rtest.currentAmount ( )
                          + "; should be 70");
      rtest.refill (40);
      System.out.println ("current contents = " 
                          + rtest.currentAmount ( )
                          + "; should be 110");
      rtest.refill (5);
      System.out.println ("current contents = " 
                          + rtest.currentAmount ( )
                          + "; should be 115");
   }
}
