      <p audio="name3_1">Here are some differences between the <tt>Refillable</tt> and <tt>Name</tt> classes.</p>
      <ul>

         
         <li audio="name3_2">There is a <tt>private</tt> method, <tt>caseFixed</tt>.
         </li>
                  
         <li audio="name3_3">That private method has a variable declaration <i>inside</i> it. 
               Whoa.  We'll come back to that.
         </li>
		 
         
         <li audio="name3_4">The instance variables have type <tt>String</tt>, as do
            all the methods.  There isn't a number in sight!
         </li>
		 
         
         <li audio="name3_5">In the <tt>caseFixed</tt> method, there are several
            strange expressions and words that aren't anywhere
            else in the program (e.g., <tt>substring</tt>).  
            A period is used in a lot
            of places, separating the words. 
             We'll come back to that as well!
