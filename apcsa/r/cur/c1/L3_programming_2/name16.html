      <p audio="name16_1">The <tt>caseFixed</tt> method has some other interesting features.</p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="name16_2">
            It's a private method, intended solely for use by the <tt>Name</tt> constructor. 
               It's not accessible from outside <tt>Name</tt>.
         </li>
         <li audio="name16_3">
            It uses a <span class="vocab">local variable</span> named <tt>temp</tt>. 
               Since <tt>temp</tt> is declared in <tt>caseFixed</tt>, 
               it can be used only within <tt>caseFixed</tt>.
         </li>
         <li audio="name16_4">
            It calls several <tt>String</tt> methods. 
               We have seen how to call methods of objects in the BlueJ workbench, 
               but this is our introduction to calling methods inside the top-level methods. 
               If <i>objectName</i> is the name of an object and <i>methodName</i> is the name
               of a method in the corresponding class, then the expression
            <pre class="width60"><i>objectName . methodName (parameters)</i></pre>
            calls the named method.
         </li>
