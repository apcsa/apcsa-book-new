Suppose a <tt>String</tt> object named <tt>str</tt> contains a sequence of letters, followed by a single blank character, followed by another sequence of letters, for example, "hi there".
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Use <tt>substring</tt> and <tt>indexOf</tt> to split <tt>str</tt>,
copying the first sequence of letters into a <tt>String strLeft</tt>,
then copying the second sequence of letters into a <tt>String strRight</tt>.
For example, if <tt>str</tt> contains "hi there", your code should copy "hi" into <tt>strLeft</tt> and "there" into <tt>strRight</tt>.
