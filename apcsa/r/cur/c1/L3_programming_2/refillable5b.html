 Write the method header (signature) for the <tt>increase</tt> method. &nbsp;
 Remember that the header consists of four parts: access, type, name,
 and parameters. &nbsp; The access for this method is public. &nbsp; After you write
 the header, explain your choice for the type. &nbsp; Also, briefly explain 
 your choice for the names of the method and the parameter.

The type should be void because this method does not return an answer.  It just changes something.  increase seems like a good name for the method because it increases the score.  amount is a good name for the parameter because it is the amount by which the score increases.
