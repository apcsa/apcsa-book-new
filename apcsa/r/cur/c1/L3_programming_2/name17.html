      <p audio="name17_1">The <tt>String</tt> class provides many methods. 
         Documentation for the <tt>String</tt> class and 
         for the rest of Java  
         is available online.  Java is a <i>huge</i> programming
         language, with many thousands of built-in methods.</p>

         <p audio="name17_2">Open a browser window to 
         <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/"

      <p audio="name17_3">You have opened the "Java API".  "API" stands for the term 
         "application programming interface", which is a definition  
         you <i>don't</i> need to remember.  An API is a list of 
         built-in methods, and, in Java's case, also has descriptions
         of classes, tutorials on how to use them, and so forth.</p>
      <p audio="name17_4">Let's look further:</p>
      <p class="step" audio="name17_5">Scroll the left menu down and select <tt>String</tt>; 
         a page explaining the <tt>String</tt> class appears. </p>
      <p class="step" audio="name17_6">Scroll down to the section named "Method Detail", 
         and then look for the methods <tt>toLowerCase</tt>, <tt>trim</tt>, 
         and <tt>substring</tt> that are used 
         in the <tt>Name</tt> methods.</p>
      <p audio="name17_7">Can you make any sense of the Java API?  You will after some
         more time in this course!</p>
