            Up until this point, we've been dealing with manipulating the inner workings of an object. 
            What if we would like to communicate to the  
            outside world that changes are happening or that methods are being called? 
        </p>
        <p audio="system1_2">
        One way to perform this communication in Java is 
        through the use of 
        <tt>System.out.println()</tt>. For now, think about 
        <tt>System.out.println()</tt>
        as a special method that comes packaged with Java. 
        <tt>System.out.println()</tt>
        can take String objects or variables and will print the given string 
        or the contents of the variable into the output area of wherever the program is being run from  
        (in your case, this is the BlueJ editor). We call this 
        "printing to the <span class="vocab top25">console</span>". 
        </p>
