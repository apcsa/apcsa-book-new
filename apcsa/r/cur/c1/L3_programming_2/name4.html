	  <p audio="name4_1">The <tt>Name</tt> class use Java <tt>Strings</tt>. The <tt>String</tt> class is built-in, a class supplied in the Java language.  We will experiment with <tt>String</tt> objects, then return to the <tt>Name</tt> class.
</p>
<p><tt>String</tt> objects have some useful properties:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
         
		 <li audio="name4_2">A <tt>String</tt> object represents a sequence 
         of <span class="vocab" term="character">characters</span>&mdash;basically, 
         things you can type at the keyboard (including the space character and punctuation) </li>
         
		 <li audio="name4_3">A <tt>String</tt> constant is surrounded by 
		 double-quote marks, e.g. <tt>"java"</tt>. </li>
         
		 <li audio="name4_4">The characters in a <tt>String</tt> are numbered: the first character (the "j" in "java") 
         has number 0, the next (the "a" in "java") has number 1, and so on. 
         This number is sometimes called the <span class="vocab">index</span> of the character 
         in the <tt>String</tt> object.</li>
