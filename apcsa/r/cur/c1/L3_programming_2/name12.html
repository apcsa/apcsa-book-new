   <body>
      <p audio="name12_1">When we looked at various "refillable" classes, 
      such as the <tt>CokeCooler</tt> and <tt>Score</tt>, we used
      the notion of <i>abstraction</i> to see a similar pattern
      underneath them all.
      </p>
      <p audio="name12_2">Abstraction can also be used here, with the various "fix" methods.
      In fact, they are all identical except for the particular
       part of the name being fixed.
         If the part of the name is supplied  as a parameter,
         the three copies of the "fix..." method can be shrunk into one.</p>
         <p audio="name12_3">This makes a more "general" method that is more useful in the long run,
		 because it can be used in multiple ways. </p>
