         <p audio="refill8b_1.m1">Up to now, we've only talked about objects from the real world,
            and programs that represent them.  But... what is a "refillable"?</p>

         <p audio="refill8b_2.m4">There is nothing in <i>your</i> world that corresponds to
            a refillable.</p>

         <p audio="refill8b_3.m1">Exactly!  Thanks, I think.

            The important point is that classes like <tt>Refillable</tt>
            are useful, despite not being an example of a thing in the real
            world.  In some ways, this might make it more useful, because
            it can fill in for so many things.
