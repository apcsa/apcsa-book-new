 As a first step of writing the <tt>averageUse</tt>

 Of the following choices, which is the best return type

        <div class="feedback"> No. Remember, the "type" of method is the type of the 
variable that it returns. <tt>void</tt> types don't return anything,

        <div class="feedback"> Yes, the "type" of method is the type of the 
variable that it returns, and <tt>averageUse</tt> is going
to return a number. You may have noticed that <tt>int</tt>
can't return a number with a decimal point (such
as <tt>3.4</tt>). That is correct! And, that makes
<tt>int</tt> not the perfect choice. Later in the course,
we'll explore types in Java that do allow decimal points.

isn't going to return an entire <tt>Refillable</tt> instance!
