      <p>The <tt>double</tt> type provides a way to store values with a fractional part. 
         If a variable named <tt>percentage</tt> has been declared of type <tt>double</tt>,</p>
      <pre>
private double percentage; </pre>
      <p> you can later assign a value such as <tt>5.3</tt> to it:</p>
      <pre>
percentage = 5.3; </pre>


      <!--
      Note: Maybe this should be part of the main presentation.
      We could then ask questions about whether <tt>int</tt>
      or <tt>double</tt>
      best models a particular application.
      Names could be a problem: "DiscreteRefillable" vs. "ContinuousRefillable"? Ugh.
