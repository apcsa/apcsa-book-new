Nope. A string with a space in it is quite different, to Java at
least, than a string without anything in it. In the statement above,
both of the strings that are being concatenated are empty. So, the
space in this choice won't just appear out of the blue. Remember,
programming is sometimes like satisfying a finicky teacher.

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 2">
        <div class="text">

        </div>
        <div class="feedback">
Right. Gluing together two completely empty strings (those without
<em>anything</em> in them, even spaces) will result in an empty
string. Remember, a string with a space in it, or anything, is 
different than an empty string.

No. The plus is an operator in this statement, 
and won't show up in the result string.

Nope! Where would the zero come from?
