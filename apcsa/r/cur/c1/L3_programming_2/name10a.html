      <p audio="name10a_1">Let's examine the <tt>Name</tt> constructor more closely:
	  </p>
	  <pre class="width80">
public Name (String first, String middle, String last) {
   myFirst = caseFixed(first);
   myMiddle = caseFixed(middle);
   myLast = caseFixed(last);
}
</pre>
		
	  
	  <p audio="name10a_2">It takes three parameters, and assigns them to each of the 
	  instance variables.  However, it is using the <tt>caseFixed</tt>
	  method to <em>transform</em> each of the parameters prior to assigning them to the instance variables. 
	  That is, it passes 
	  each parameter into <tt>caseFixed</tt>, and then assigns the 
	  instance variable to <tt>caseFixed</tt>'s return value.</p>
	  
	<p audio="name10a_3"> As you might expect from the name, the <tt>caseFixed</tt> method
	is making sure that the capitalization of each parameter is correct:
	that they start with a capital letter and contain only lower-case
         letters thereafter.  We'll look more closely at it in a bit.</p>
