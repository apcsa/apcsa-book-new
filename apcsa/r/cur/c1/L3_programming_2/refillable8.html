 <p audio="1">

 We've discussed candy jars, soda machines, and score keeping.

 Name two other objects in the real-world that are refillable.

 You might consult with the <tt>Refillable</tt>

 class in the previous

 step, to see the behaviors and methods that it has.

        <div name="Grace">Example 1: bank account. My bank account increases or decreases depending on whether I deposit or withdraw money. Example 2: My stapler use up staples when I staple papers, but the amount of staples can be refilled if I put more staples in.

        <div name="Savannah">I can think of objects in real life that are refillable:

1. Water bottle. I decrease the amount when I drink water, and refill it at a tap when I need more water.

2. Bookshelf. I can take books out of it and put books into it. In the Refillable class however, I won't be able to differentiate between the books.
