      <p audio="refillable1_1">You are ready to design your own class
         to model something that's similar to a candy jar.
         Here's an example.</p>
      <p audio="refillable1_2">Google (the company that developed the Internet search program)
         provides free soft drinks for its programmers.
         In particular, they have a refrigerator that contains only cans 
         of Coca Cola&#0153;. 
         In the next few steps, you'll design
		 a <tt>CokeCooler</tt> class that provides the following methods:</p>
       <div class="floatClear"></div>
      <ul>
         <li audio="refillable1_3">
            a constructor that takes a positive integer as an argument 
            (the number of Cokes initially in the refrigerator);
         </li>
         <li audio="refillable1_4">
            a <tt>drink</tt>
            method whose single integer argument says 
            how many Cokes are being removed from the refrigerator;
         </li>
         <li audio="refillable1_5">
            a <tt>refill</tt>
            method whose single integer argument says 
            how many Cokes are being added to the refrigerator;
         </li>
         <li audio="refillable1_6">
            a <tt>cokeCount</tt>
            method that returns 
            the number of Cokes in the refrigerator.
         </li>
      </ul>
