      <title>Limitations of values of type <tt>double</tt></title>

</head>
<body>
<p>
Bits are arranged in a different way to store <tt>double</tt> values.
Each <tt>double</tt> value is stored in 64 <span class="vocab" term="bit">bits</span>, 
some of which represent
the <span class="vocab">exponent</span>, and some the <span class="vocab">coefficient</span>.
This is similar to <span class="vocab">scientific notation</span>,
used to represent values in biology, physics, and chemistry.
</p>
<p>
The fractional part of the coefficient is expressed in terms of
fractional powers of 2.
For example, the decimal value .5 is represented as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>,
and .65625 is represented as the sum 
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> + <sup>1</sup>/<sub>32</sub>
= .5 + .125 + .03125.
</p>
<p>
Problems arise when the fraction is <i>not</i> exactly representable
by a sum of fractional powers of 2.
The fraction must then be approximated by the closest value that is
represented with such a sum.
An entire field of computer science, called <i>numerical analysis</i>,
focuses on managing the inexact nature of computation involving 
<tt>double</tt> values.
