 The average use is determined by dividing the sum of values passed to <tt>useUp</tt> by the number of calls to <tt>useUp</tt>. &nbsp;

 We thus need two more instance variables to be able to compute the average:

 </p>

 <ol>

 <li audio="2">the number of times <tt>useUp</tt> is called, and</li>

 <li audio="3">the sum of the arguments supplied in each call to <tt>useUp</tt></li>

 </ol>

 <p audio="4">

 What are good names for these variables?

        <div name="Karena">1. useUpCount will accumulate how many times useUp is called in total, so I think a variable that serves as a counter should have the term 'count' in it.

2. allThingsUsed is a good name because it will keep count of every argument that is supplied in a call to useUp.
