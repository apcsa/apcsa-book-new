         a name in a variable.  So far, all you have seen is variables that can
         handle numbers (e.g., <tt>int</tt>).</p>
         <p audio="name0a_2.f1">Well, you are right to wonder.  The <tt>Name</tt> class is going
         to use variables of a new type: <tt>String</tt>.</p>

         it because I think of it as a 'string' of letters, all in a row.
