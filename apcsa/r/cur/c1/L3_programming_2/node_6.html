<p>
As we just noted, in any arithmetic operation involving both
a <tt>double</tt> and an <tt>int</tt>, the <tt>int</tt> gets
converted to a <tt>double</tt> before the operation is performed.
The conversion conceptually has the result of adding ".0" to the
end of the integer.
</p>
<p>
Essentially the same thing happens in an assignment of an <tt>int</tt>
right-hand side to a <tt>double</tt> variable:
</p>
<pre>
   double x;
   x = 25;      // x now contains 25.0
</pre>
<p>
Assigning a <tt>double</tt> value to an <tt>int</tt> variable,
however, produces a compiler error: "Possible loss of precision" in BlueJ.
The compiler is protecting us from accidentally throwing away part of
the <tt>double</tt> value&mdash;the part after the decimal point&mdash;even
if it's zero.
We'll see later in the course how to get around this limitation.
