<title>The substring method</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The <tt>String</tt> <tt>substring</tt> method returns a different <tt>String</tt> that is a <i>substring</i> of the original.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>String</tt> class has two different versions of the <tt>substring</tt> method.  Since both of the methods are named <tt>substring</tt>, how does Java know which one to use?  Java is able to distinguish between the two methods based upon the number of arguments passed to the methods.  For example,
</p>
<p class="redFlag">
<tt>s.substring<b>(5);</b></tt></br></br>
is a different method call than</br></br> 
<tt>s.substring<b>(5,2)</b>;</tt></p>
<p>
because the first method has only <b>one argument</b> and the second method has <b>two arguments</b>.
