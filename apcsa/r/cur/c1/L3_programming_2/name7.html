The "+" just knows how to treat things differently.

The difference in the two expresssion is the <em>types</em> of the elements.
The '+' operator works differently when it is placed between numbers (ints)
and strings.  In the statement <tt>12 + 23</tt>, both the elements are numbers,
and the '+' operator will add them.  In the statement <tt>"12" + "23"</tt>, 
the elements are strings.  You know this because of the double-quotation marks.
When given strings, the '+' operator does a concatenation on them.  That is,
it glues them together.  <br><br>
So, what do you think will happen if you type <tt>"12" + 23</tt>?  Try it!
