            than it does with <tt>int</tt> values. </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="name6b_2">Applied to two strings, "+" means <span class="vocab">concatenation</span>. 
         What results is a string whose value is that of 
         the two original strings, glued together.</p>
      <p audio="name6b_3">For instance, the statement:</p>
      <pre class="width40">"Hillary" + "Clinton"</pre>
      <p audio="name6b_4">will result in the string </p>
      <pre class="width40">"HillaryClinton"</pre>
      <p audio="name6b_5">Note that 
         there isn't any space between the words, because neither of the 
         strings that were glued together had a space.</p>
