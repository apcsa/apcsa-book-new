<title>The <tt>double</tt> type</title>
<hr>
<p>
The <tt>double</tt> type provides a way to store values with a fractional part.
If a variable named <tt>percentage</tt> has been declared of type <tt>double</tt>,
one can assign a value such as 5.3 to it:
</p>
<code>
	percentage = 5.3;
</code>

<!-- TODO
 Note: Maybe this should be part of the main presentation.
We could then ask questions about whether <tt>int</tt> or <tt>double</tt> 
best models a particular application. 
Names could be a problem: "DiscreteRefillable" vs. "ContinuousRefillable"? Ugh.
