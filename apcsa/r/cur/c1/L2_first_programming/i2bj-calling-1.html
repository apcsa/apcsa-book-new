    <body>
        <p audio="calling1_1">
            Now that we have an object, we can call its methods. 
            Right-click on the <tt>gameBoar1</tt> object on the object bench, and select <tt>void showBoard()</tt> from the list of options. 
            A new board will be drawn in another window. <a class="slideshowLink" href="slideshow4.html" onClick="return openChild(this.href);">1</a>
        </p>
        <p audio="calling1_2">
            The list of options that shows up when you right-clicked on the <tt>gameBoar1</tt> object 
            are the methods of the <tt>GameBoard</tt> class 
            (and, therefore, of objects built from that class).
        </p>
        <p audio="calling1_3">
            The name of the method is <strong><tt>showBoard</tt></strong>.  You'll notice that BlueJ adds more information than just the name, 
            however.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li audio="calling1_4">The word <tt><span class="vocab">void</span></tt> at the front indicates what type of thing the method will 
                return after it has been run.  This method returns nothing, which in Java is described as <tt>void</tt>.</li>
            <li audio="calling1_5">The two parentheses at the end are indicating what parameters 
                the method needs to receive. There is nothing between
the parentheses, so this method takes no parameters. </li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="calling1_6">
            Selecting a method calls the method on the object. Try selecting <tt>void hideBoard()</tt>. 
            Does it do what you expect?
