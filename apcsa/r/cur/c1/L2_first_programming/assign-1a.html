        <p>The way to change the value of a variable is to 
      <span class="vocab">assign</span> it another value,
       by using an <span class="vocab">assignment statement</span>. </p>
     <p>The
         assignment statement starts with the name of a variable (the
         one whose value we want to change), continues with an equals 
         sign, and finishes with an <i>expression</i> that specifies
         the replacement value. Here is a straightforward example, the 
         initialization of <tt>myCandyCount</tt> in the
         constructor:</p>
         <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      <pre>public CandyJar (int startingCount) {
   myCandyCount = startingCount; 
}</pre>
      <p>This says to copy what's in the box named 
      <tt>startingCount</tt> into the box named <tt>myCandyCount</tt>, 
      replacing whatever was there
         before.</p>
