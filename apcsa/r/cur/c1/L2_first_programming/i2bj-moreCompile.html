Computer programs are written with a computer programming language
that humans can learn to read and write.

</p>
        <p audio="morecompile2">Computers, on the other hand, can only understand programs in executable code, which is very different from Java. 
            In order for the computer to execute programs written in Java, the program must be "translated" into the language that it understands.  
            As noted earlier, this translation process is called compiling. 
            The tool that does the translation is called a compiler, which is just another program. </p>
        <p class="quoteBlue" audio="morecompile3">To summarize, we write code in the Java language, then select <i>Compile</i>. 
            The compiler translates the code into a language that the computer can understand.  
            This is why every time we change the source code, 
            we must ask the compiler to compile the code again to make sure that the computer sees the new changes. </p>
