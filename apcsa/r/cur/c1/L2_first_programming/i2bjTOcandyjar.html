      <p audio="candyjar1_1">Today, let's think about objects as cars; every class 
         represents a different model, and each object is an actual  
         car of that model. </p>
      <p audio="candyjar1_2">Last time, we saw how to create a<tt> GameBoard</tt> object and took it for a "test drive" in BlueJ. We
         were able to see what the car could do (<tt>GameBoard</tt>'s methods),
         and some of the car's features (<tt>GameBoard</tt>'s parameters). We 
         even "built" new cars! </p>

         <p audio="candyjar1_3.m1">Now we are going take a look under the 
            hood to see just how <tt>GameBoard</tt> and other types of objects 
            really work; we are going to examine the actual models. </p>
      </div>
      <p class="quoteBlue" audio="candyjar1_4">
      	In 
         BlueJ, we can see how objects look in the outside world, but  
         now we are going to focus more closely on the inner workings 
         of objects and classes in Java. For the next few lessons, we  
         will be examining in detail the <span class="vocab top125">source code</span>&nbsp;of objects.
