        We have discussed the distinction between classes and objects in previous activities. 
        In BlueJ, we build, or <strong>construct</strong>, an object from a class.
        Here's how we do it.
    </p>
    <p class="step click" audio="instantiate2">
        Right-click on the <tt>GameBoard</tt> class. From the list options, choose <tt>Compile</tt>. 
        By choosing compile, you have asked the computer to turn the <i>source</i> code into <i>object</i> code
        What do you see on the screen?<br/><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a slide show of these steps if you prefer an illustration: <a class="slideshowLink" href="slideshow3.html" onClick="return openChild(this.href);">1</a>
    </p>
    <p class="step click" audio="instantiate3">
        Right-click on the <tt>GameBoard</tt> class. From the list options, choose <tt>new GameBoard()</tt>. 
        You will be asked for a "name of the instance"; clicking OK  will do for now. 
        What do you see on the screen?
    </p>
    <p class="step result" audio="instantiate4">
        You should see a rectangle 
        at the bottom of the screen called <tt>gameBoar1: GameBoard</tt>. 
        Congratulations, you've just made your first object in BlueJ! 
    </p>

    <p class="quoteBlue" audio="instantiate7">
        <tt>gameBoar1</tt> may seem like a strange name for a <tt>GameBoard</tt>.  What happened to the 'd'?  By default, BlueJ uses the first eight characters of the class name followed by a number, so the 'd' got cut off.  If you named it yourself, you could name it <tt>gameBoard1</tt> or any other legal Java name.  However, for now, <tt>gameBoar1</tt> will work just fine.</span>
