        <div name="Sondra">Maybe they meant that the eat method will round the number, so that it will only be 5 instead of 5.3. That's probably a warning.

        <div name="Nathan Hawthrone">Maybe it is telling us that there should be more decimals but it isn't showing us. Like 5.346

        <div name="Helga">Maybe it wants to round up but couldn't .. 5.3 -- I want to be 6 but now I 5.
