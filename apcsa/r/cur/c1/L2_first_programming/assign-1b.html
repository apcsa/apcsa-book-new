        <p>
            A possibly more confusing assignment is the statement in <tt>refill</tt>
            that increases <tt>myCandyCount</tt>:
        </p>
        <pre>public void refill (int amount) {
   myCandyCount = myCandyCount + amount;
}</pre>
        <p>
            In algebra, a statement like <tt>myCandyCount =
                myCandyCount + amount</tt>
            would make no sense, at least if <tt>amount</tt>
            weren't zero. But in Java, here's what
            happens:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The value in the box named <tt>myCandyCount</tt>
                    is
                    added to the value in the box named <tt>amount</tt>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The result of adding in Step 1 <em>replaces</em>
                    the value in <tt>myCandyCount</tt>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The statements in a method are referred to as the 
             <span class="vocab">method body</span>. The bodies of 
            the various <tt>CandyJar</tt>
            methods each consist of only one assignment
            statement. We will soon, however, see examples of longer
            methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid confusion, we usually read the equals sign in an
            assignment as "gets", for example, "myCandyCount gets myCandyCount plus amount".        </p>
        <p>Another way you could say this would be &quot;make myCandyCount equal to myCandyCount plus amount&quot;.<br>
