            One way for objects to interact with one another is by calling each other's methods. 
            We will illustrate this idea using the game board and its game pieces.  
            The idea will be revisited in more detail in a future lesson.

            Clear the object bench of all objects.  Right-click on each object (the board and all the pieces) and choose <i>remove</i>.<br/><br/>
            Now create a new board and three new game pieces. 
            You should see four objects on the object bench <i>(see below)</i>. 
            Right-click the board object and call the method <tt>moveEveryPiece()</tt>. 
            Observe what happened to the configuration.  
            The method <tt>moveEveryPiece()</tt>, as its name implies, moves every piece on the board to a new location. 
            Briefly, this is achieved by having the board object calling a <tt>move</tt> method on every <tt>GamePiece</tt>
            object currently on the board.
