                if not, it complains, and you have to fix what's wrong.  The Java compiler is very particular when looking
                over your program.  Even the smallest error will cause it to stop and complain.</li>
            <li audio="analogy5">If your programming code contains no errors, 
                the compiler translates it into  
                something that can be executed.  Programmers call this <span class="vocab" term="object code">object code</span>.</li>
