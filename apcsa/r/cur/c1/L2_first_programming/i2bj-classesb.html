                There are actually two kinds of arrows, as you can see in the buttons at the left of the main BlueJ 
                window <a class="slideshowLink" href="slideshow2.html" onclick="return openChild(this.href);">1</a>.  The "uses" arrow is dashed and has an open head.  You'll learn about 
                the other kind of arrow in a few weeks.
