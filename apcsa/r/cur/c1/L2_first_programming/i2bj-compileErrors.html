      <p audio="compileErr1">Open the <code>GameBoard</code> class in the BlueJ editor. 
         Change one of the occurrences of the word <tt>myDisplay</tt> to <tt>yourDisplay</tt>. Now try compiling the class by 
         clicking on the <i>Compile</i> button at the top of the editor
         window.</p>

      <p audio="compileErr2">What's going on here? The line that we just changed is now
         highlighted in yellow. Also, notice a message has appeared at
         the bottom of the editor window that reads: "cannot find
         symbol - variable yourDisplay".</p>
      <p class="quoteBrown" audio="compileErr3">BlueJ is trying to tell us that the compiler is having
         trouble understanding the line highlighted in yellow. This
         typically means that you've made a mistake at that line. The
         error message is generated by the compiler and it tries to be
         as informative as possible about what exactly it is that it
         doesn't understand. In this example, the changes that we made 
         introduced a <span class="vocab">compile-time error</span>. Change it back and compile the class
         again.</p>

            objects' methods.</p>
