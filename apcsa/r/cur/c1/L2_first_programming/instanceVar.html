         The <tt>CandyJar</tt>
         class has just one instance variable.
         Our name for it is <tt>myCandyCount</tt>.
         We will almost always choose to start 
         each name of an instance variable 
         with "my"; if a <tt>CandyJar</tt>
         object were talking to us,
         it would talk about "my candy".

      <p audio="instancevar1_2">
         Java instance variables by convention start with a lower-case letter.
         In a variable name that in English would be two or more words,
         we will use use lower case for the first word and upper case for all the remaining words.  For example, "my candy count" is made up of three English words.  As an instance variable, we would use lower case for the first word and upper case for the remaining two words resulting in an instance variable name of <tt>myCandyCount</tt>.
