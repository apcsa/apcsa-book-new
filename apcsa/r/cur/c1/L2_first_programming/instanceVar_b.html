            The <tt>CandyJar</tt> class is <span class="vocab">public</span>,

            Here, that's <tt>int</tt>, meaning that we are representing the contents of 
            the <tt>CandyJar</tt> object as a whole number, or an <span class="vocab">integer</span>.

            This was a design decision.  A <tt>CandyJar</tt> object will be able to hold
