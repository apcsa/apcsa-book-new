      <p>The <tt>myCandyCount</tt> variable is keeping track of how 
         much the <tt>CandyJar</tt> object holds. We've said that
         the constructor supplies the initial quantity of candy,
         the<tt>eat</tt> method reduces it, and the <tt>refill</tt> method increases it.  How is this done?</p>

      <p>A good way to think about a variable 
         is as a <i>box</i> that 
         holds only one thing. All variables have

      <ul><li>a <span class= "vocab">name</span>, specified in the declaration, </li>
      
      <li>a <span class="vocab">type</span>, also specified in the declaration,
       that says what kind of thing it can hold,</li>
       
       <li>and a <span class= "vocab">value</span>, what it's actually holding.</li>

         Double-clicking on <tt>candyJar1</tt> produces a window that 
         shows the <tt>myCandyCount</tt> box.
