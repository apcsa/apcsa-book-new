      <p audio="source1">So far, we've been creating objects of classes in the project <tt>GameBoard</tt> by right-clicking the rectangles. 
         As you know, every class is defined by some source code, which is the text that defines the state and behavior of the class.  
         In BlueJ, you can view the source code of a class by double-clicking the rectangle corresponding to the class 
         or by selecting the <i>Open Editor</i> function from the class's popup menu.</p>
      <div class="tryit">
         <p audio="source2">Double-click the <code>GameBoard</code>
         class, and an <span class="vocab" term="editor">editor window</span>
         will appear. The editor window shows the variables that represent the state of the <code>GameBoard</code>
         class, and the methods that represent its behaviors.  
         When you create your own classes, you have to provide variables and methods using the source code editor. </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="source3">In Java, the name of the class must match the name of the file containing the definition of the class. 
         In our case, the name of the class is "GameBoard" and the file containing its implementation is  "GameBoard.java". </p>
