      <p audio="methods2_1"> The third method in the <tt>CandyJar</tt> class, named <tt>candyCount</tt>, 
         doesn't change any state information;
         it merely informs the caller how many pieces of candy 
         are currently in the jar. </p>
         <p audio="methods2_2">You'll notice that this is the only method whose name
         is followed by parentheses that don't contain any information.
         More about that later!</p>
      <pre class="width50">   public int candyCount ( ) {

</pre>
      <p audio="methods2_3">The fourth method is a <span class="vocab top100">constructor</span>. 
         Its role is to give initial values 
         to the instance variables.  Constructors are generally called 
         once, when the object is first made.</p>
