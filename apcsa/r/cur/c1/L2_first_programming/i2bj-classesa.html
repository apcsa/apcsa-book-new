            In BlueJ, every class is represented as a box, 
            with arrows showing the relationship between classes.

            Now, let's take a look at the content of the <tt>GameBoard</tt>
            project <a class="slideshowLink" href="slideshow2.html" onClick="return openChild(this.href);">1</a>. 
            As the screenshot shows, BlueJ shows a project as a collection of rectangles with arrows.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p audio="classA3">
        Each of the rectangles represents a class in the project. 
        In the <tt>GameBoard</tt>
        project there are two classes, the <tt>GamePiece</tt> class and 
        the <tt>GameBoard</tt>
        class.
    </p>
    <p class="quoteOrange" audio="classA4">
        The arrows between the rectangles show how the classes relate to one another. 
        If there is an arrow pointing from one rectangle to another rectangle,  
        it means that the class corresponding 
        to the first rectangle <em>uses</em>
        the class corresponding to the second rectangle. 
        This means that there is some behavior or instance variable in the <tt>GameBoard</tt>
        class that 
        makes, refers to, or changes a <tt>GamePiece </tt>object.
