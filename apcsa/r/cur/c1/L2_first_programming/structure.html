      <title>The big structure of the <tt>CandyJar</tt> class</title>

         Let's examine this class. First, notice the overall structure.
         Like other classes we will see in this course,
         it starts with the words "public class", followed by the name "CandyJar",
         followed by a left brace, followed by the "guts" of the class,
         followed by a right brace at the end of the code.
      </p>
      <pre class="width80">
public class CandyJar {

   <b><i>... the guts of the class ...</i></b> 
	
}
</pre>
      <p audio="structure1_2">
         Class names in Java, by convention, start with a capital letter.
         For a class name that really stands for two or more words, there are two common conventions:
</p>
      <ol>
        
            <li audio="structure1_3">
               Capitalize all the words, then concatenate them (i.e. glue them together).  For example,
               the words "candy jar" would be capitalized and then concatenated to form "CandyJar".
            
         </li>
        
            <li audio="structure1_4">
               Separate the word with an underscore character ("_").
               That would result in the name "Candy_jar".
          
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p audio="structure1_5">
         We will use naming convention #1 in this course.
      Thus, the name of our class is <tt>CandyJar</tt>, not <tt>Candy_jar</tt>.</p>
