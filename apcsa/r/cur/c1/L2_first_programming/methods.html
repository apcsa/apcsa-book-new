      <p audio="methods1_1">The <tt>CandyJar</tt> class has four methods. </p>
      <p audio="methods1_2">The <tt>eat</tt> method implements the eating behavior 
         we talked about earlier. 
         Eating some of the candy means reducing the value of the <tt>myCandyCount</tt> instance variable. </p>
      <pre class="width50">public void eat (int amount) {
   myCandyCount = myCandyCount - amount; 
}</pre>
      <p audio="methods1_3">The second method is <tt>refill</tt>.  Refilling a <tt>CandyJar</tt> 
      increases the value of the <tt>myCandyCount</tt> instance variable.</p>
      <pre class="width50">public void refill (int amount) {
   myCandyCount = myCandyCount + amount; 
}</pre>
<br />
      <div class="talkBubble" char="twitterton2" color="orange" align="right">
         <p audio="methods1_4.m4">Method names follow the same conventions as variable names for 
            capitalization: they start with a lower case letter and additional words are capitalized. 
            <br>
            <br>
            But, they don't generally start with the word "my", because that 
            isn't a natural way to talk about behaviors.
