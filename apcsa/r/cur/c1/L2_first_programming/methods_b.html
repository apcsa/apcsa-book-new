      <p audio="methods3_1"> Here are all the <span class="vocab" term="method header">method
       headers</span>, or the first line of their definitions.  (You 
       can also call this the method's <span class="vocab">signature</span>).
    </p>
      <pre class="width60">   public void eat (int amount)
   public void refill (int amount)
   public int candyCount ( )
   public CandyJar (int startingCount)</pre>
      <p audio="methods3_2">
      The header
      for each method contains four important pieces of information:
	  </p>
	  
      <ul>
         
            <li audio="methods3_3">The method's accessibility (<tt>public</tt> or <tt>private</tt>,
               according to whether or not something in another class is allowed to call it).
			   </li>
       
       
            <li audio="methods3_4">The kind of value it returns.  <tt>void</tt> means it doesn't return any information,
            while <tt>int</tt> means that it will return an integer.
               And, constructors are special, and don't specify a return type.
         </li>
            <li audio="methods3_4b">The name of the method.  Again,
            constructors are special: the name of a constructor is the 
            same as the name of the class.</li>
            <li audio="methods3_5">The types and names for the method's <span class="vocab" term="parameter">parameters</span>, 
               which specify how information is given to the method (and,
               this means, how information is given to the object with those
               methods).
               <br/><br/>The parameters in the <tt>eat</tt> and <tt>refill</tt> methods
               tell the method how much should be taken away or added to the
               <tt>CandyJar</tt>'s instance variable.  For the constructor, this parameter
               specifies how much candy should be in the jar when it is 
               created.  And the poor <tt>candyCount</tt> method doesn't
               need any parameters to do its job.</li>
       
      </ul>
