      <p audio="openproj1">When BlueJ first opens, you will see a window with a few buttons on the left and a large, mostly blank area. 
         Let's open the <tt>GameBoard</tt> project, a simple Java version of the demonstration you saw earlier.</p>
      <p audio="openproj2">There are special BlueJ steps in the project that are linked to the BlueJ application. When you see the box
         below, it means you are on a special BlueJ step. </p>

            <p audio="openproj3">Open the <b>GameBoard</b> project</p>

      <p class="step" audio="openproj4"><i>Start BlueJ</i>, if you don't already have it running.
</p>
      <p class="step" audio="openproj5"><i>Open the current BlueJ project</i>: To open the current BlueJ project, which for
      this step is the <tt>GameBoard</tt> project, click <b>Tools</b> on the menu bar and 
         select <b>Open Current BlueJ Project</b> from the drop-down menu.  The <tt>GameBoard</tt> project
         should automatically load, because you are at a special BlueJ page.  Try it now.</p>
