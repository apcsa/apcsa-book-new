        <p audio="calling2_1">
            Recall the discussion of <span class="vocab" term="parameter">parameters</span>, pieces of information that let us write more general methods.
            Here's how a method with a parameter is called in BlueJ.
        </p>
        <p class="step" audio="calling2_2">
            Make an object of the <tt>GamePiece</tt> class, and call it<tt> piece1</tt>. 
            It should appear in the object bench. Here's a slide show depicting the following steps if you get confused: <a class="slideshowLink" href="slideshow5.html" onClick="return openChild(this.href);">1</a>
        </p>
        <p class="step" audio="calling2_3">
            To make your object visible in the window associated with <tt>gameBoar1</tt>, we need to add the piece to the board.  Adding a piece is a 
            behavior of a <tt>GameBoard</tt>, rather than a <tt>GamePiece</tt>. 
            Right-click on the <tt>gameBoar1</tt>
            object in the object 
            bench, and select the <tt>addPiece method</tt>. 
        </p>
        <p class="step" audio="calling2_4">
            A dialog box will open up
            and you will be asked to type three things, because the <tt>addPiece</tt> method requires three parameters.
			</p>
		
            <ol>
                <li audio="calling2_5">The first is the piece&mdash;an object instantiated from the <tt>GamePiece</tt> class 
                    &mdash;to add. 
                    Provide the name of the piece to add in the top text box; your  <tt>GamePiece</tt> object is named <tt>piece1</tt>, so type that in
                    the first slot.</li>
                <li audio="calling2_6">The other two parameters indicate the location where this piece 
                    is to appear on the board. Enter <tt>1</tt> for the row number 
                    and <tt>1</tt> for the column number.</li>
            </ol>
    
        <p class="step" audio="calling2_7">
            Click OK, and you have added <tt>piece1</tt> to <tt>gameBoar1</tt>. 
            Call the <tt>showBoard</tt> method, then look at <tt>gameBoar1</tt>'s window and check that the piece was added. 
        </p>
        <p class="question" audio="calling2_8">
            Was this piece added in the place you expected?
        </p>
