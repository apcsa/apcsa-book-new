      <title>The BlueJ development environment</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="bluej1">A <span class="vocab">development environment</span> is a tool that helps you to write, build, 
         and organize the files and classes in your program.  
         In this course, we will be using the <b>BlueJ</b> development environment to create Java programs. </p>
      <p audio="bluej2">This section introduces the key aspects of BlueJ you'll need to get started. 
         Over the course of the semester we'll progressively introduce additional features. </p>
      <p audio="bluej3">Note: To proceed, make sure that <a href="../../../page/help/installation.html" target="_help">BlueJ is installed</a> on your computer. 
         The first time you open up BlueJ, it will need to be configured.  
         The <span class="help" topic="configure_bluej">Configure BlueJ</span> page will show you how to get BlueJ running with the course.</p>
      <br/>
      <div class="tryit">
      <p audio="bluej4"><b>First, start up BlueJ.</b>
      The details of how you do this depend on what kind of computer and installation you are using. 
      </p>
   </div>
   <p audio="bluej5">BlueJ is like any other application on a computer, and starting it up should be similar to how
      you install/launch other applications. 
      Your computer may have shortcuts on its desktop, or other ways to make it easy to open. </p>
   <p audio="bluej6">If your computer has a typical installation, you can always find BlueJ 
      at <b>C:\UCCP\APCSA\BlueJ\</b> (if you are using a Windows machine) or at <b>/UCCP/APCSA/BlueJ</b> (if you are using a Macintosh).</p>
