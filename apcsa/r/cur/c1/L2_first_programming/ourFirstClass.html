      <p audio="fclass1">Now that we have developed an intuition for how Java classes are structured, let's take a look at a new Java class. Here's the code.</p>
      <img class="imageRight" src="/apcsa/r/static/art/scenes/refillable_jars.png" alt="A jar filled with candy." />
      <pre class="width70">public class CandyJar {

   private int myCandyCount;
   
   // Initialize a CandyJar object having 
   // startingCount pieces of candy.
   public CandyJar (int startingCount) {
      myCandyCount = startingCount;
   }
   
   // Eat amount pieces of candy.
   public void eat (int amount) {
      myCandyCount = myCandyCount - amount;
   }
   
   // Add amount to the candy currently in the jar.
   public void refill (int amount) {
      myCandyCount = myCandyCount + amount;
   }
   
   // Return the number of pieces of candy currently in the jar.
   public int candyCount ( ) {
      return myCandyCount;
   }
}</pre>
      <p audio="fclass2">This class models a jar of candy.
         We can eat some of the candy, we can refill the candy jar with more candy,
         and we can find out how much candy it contains.</p>
