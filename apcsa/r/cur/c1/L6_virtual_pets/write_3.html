               A pet could start out as a baby, and over many correct interactions 
               get older, start to talk, and so forth.  Remember, babies basically  
               need to be fed, have their diaper changed, sleep, and 
               be played with.  As they get older, things get more complicated.

               The pet could be a student in school, with behaviors such 
               as "take test", "snubbed by best friend", 
               "pizza day at cafeteria", "tell joke that whole class laughs at",
               and so forth.

               Your pet could be a famous celebrity, with moods that only 
               a celebrity could think were appropriate.  Behaviors might 
               include "attend oscars", "dump rich boyfriend", "sleep
               in late", and so forth.  Think about what kinds of 
               interesting interactions
               can happen based on the celebrities state of mind (i.e.,
               instance variable values).

               A pet could allow many different eating behaviors, covering 
               all different types of food.  The pets moods ("upset  
               stomach", "bloated", and so forth) would depend 
               on whether the meal was balanced, it got desert when 
               it wanted it, and so forth.  Think of this pet as a
               nutritional tutorial.

               A pet could act out a story, one where the reader 
               has to make choices about how to proceed.  The 'moods' 
               are different points in the story (e.g., "at the moving 
               staircase. Its dark here."), and the behaviors are different actions  
               the 'reader' can take (e.g., "Use a 'see in the dark' spell"). 
               If they do the right actions  
               in the right sequence, they advance the story to the 
               conclusion; a wrong behavior might reach a deadend.

               Note: Later in the course, we'll code a really
               intricate adventure game.

               Along the lines above, the pet could be playing in a game 
               (e.g., soccer, chess, and so forth).  The moods would
               be states of the game (e.g., "A tall defender looms up
               in front of you"), and the behaviors actions the player
               takes (e.g., "shoot on the goal").
