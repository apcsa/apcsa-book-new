                  virtual pet project, examining code from the
                  constructor Cam.

                  a pet was, and looked at different possible

         With just these few changes, the code we ended 
         up with got somewhat complicated.  Adding more features 
         to a program can quickly make a program <i>very</i>
         hard 
         to understand.  In this set of activities we are going to 
         look at ways to make your programs more manageable, and 
         to help you keep problems from cropping up.
