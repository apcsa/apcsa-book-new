        <p audio="audio2">To make things more entertaining, Cam  added "tiredness" to her Virtual Pet. &nbsp; Her idea was to add a    new instance variable, naming it <tt>tiredness</tt>, and adding Java statements to the behaviors so    that the value of <tt>tiredness</tt> is changed. &nbsp;Things, however, aren't working quite right.  In fact, she can't even get her code to <span class="vocab">compile</span>!</p>
        <div class="openbluejproj">
            <p audio="audio3">Open this project in BlueJ: <tt>"cam-v2"</tt> (in BlueJ, go to <i>Tools>Open Current BlueJ Project</i> to have BlueJ automatically open this project for you). 
             <br /> <br />
                Then fix Cam's code.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p audio="audio4">You'll need to make sure you check the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li audio="audio5">Confirm that the code compiles! </li>
            <li audio="audio6">If <tt>tiredness</tt> ever goes above <tt>15</tt>, the pet should be set to the "asleep" mood. </li>
            <li audio="audio7">The <tt>sleep</tt> behavior should always reset <tt>tiredness</tt>, while <tt>exercise</tt> and <tt>feed</tt> add <tt>5</tt> and <tt>2</tt> to <tt>tiredness</tt> respectively. </li>
            <li audio="audio8">If the pet is both dead (<tt>hunger</tt> over <tt>12</tt>) and asleep (<tt>tiredness</tt> over <tt>15</tt>) then the pet should die.  That is, death takes precedence over falling asleep! </li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="audio9">Don't forget that <span class="help">inspecting an object</span> is a useful way of checking on the values of its instance variables.</p>
