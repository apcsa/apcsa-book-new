         One thing that makes programming fun is seeing your 
         own ideas come to life on the computer.   To do this, 
         you often need extended time to play with your
         program and get it just right.  And, needless to say,
         this is a different process than you go through when
         you do homework or answer multiple-choice questions.

         So, you are going to take some time now to make a large 
         and interesting virtual pet program. 
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         Your teacher, if you are taking this course with one,
          may have more specific information about 
         what is expected of you, both in the finished product and 
         how long you are allowed to take. 
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         On our part, we are just going to suggest some things you 
         might get your virtual pet to do.  You don't need to follow 
         any of these in particular (unless your teacher says 
         differently).  A good-sized program, however, will 
         incorporate dozens of different moods, necessitating  a
         similarly large number of instance variables.  And, there
         should be complicated interactions that can suprise
         the person using your program.  You want them to have fun, 
         don't you?
