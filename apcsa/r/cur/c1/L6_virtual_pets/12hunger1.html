         Let's help Cam make her virtual pet a
         little more interesting. Obviously, it isn't realistic that a
         pet could get hungrier and hungrier forever. At some point
         the pet should, well, perish.

            Answer: Being "dead" is just another
            mood for the Virtual Pet. You can't just type in any mood
            name, however; we've only provided initial images for some
            moods. The moods "dead", "skeleton", and "pushingdaisies"
            will work fine, however.
