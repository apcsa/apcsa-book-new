         First, a word about the Virtual pet images that we've given you.
         You can see all of these images inside your BlueJ project folder, but not 
         using the BlueJ program itself.  Rather, use your computer's
         operating system to look at the files directly.  They are in the 
         directory
      </p>
      <pre class="width50"> Projects/lesson6/cam-v2/pet_images </pre>
      <p audio="3">
         Copy the folder <tt>cam-v2</tt> to a folder titled
          <tt>VPProject</tt>.  This is the project
          that you can start working on.
          </p>
          <p audio="4" class="quoteBlue">Another easy way to copy
          a project is from within the BlueJ program, first opening
          up the project you want to copy and then using the <tt>Save As</tt>
          menu to save it as another project.  The images will get copied
          as well.
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         We've provided many, many images, but it is likely that you 
         are going to want more as you program your own ideas.  While
         our artist made great images, you can add files yourself, either from 
         things you get on the internet or create yourself.  You'll need
         to follow the same naming scheme that we've used with our images,
         based on the mood that you want to show.  
      </p>
      <p audio="6">
         For instance, if you want a mood titled <tt>broken-toe</tt>, you'll
         need to get an image into that directory titled <tt>pet_broken-toe_1.jpg</tt>.
         (Other image formats, such as <tt>png</tt> and <tt>gif</tt> will work fine
          as well).  If you want your pet to cycle through a series of images, 
          change the number at the end of the image name in the same way we have&mdash;so,
          <tt>pet_broken-toe_1.jpg</tt>, <tt>pet_broken-toe_2.jpg</tt>, 
          <tt>pet_broken-toe_3.jpg</tt>, and so on.  Any number of images will work.
