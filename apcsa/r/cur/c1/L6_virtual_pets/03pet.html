        <p audio="audio2">Now it's time to put your knowledge of 
            conditionals into practice. For the next few days, you'll work  
            on the <span class="vocab">Virtual Pet</span> mini-project.</p>
        <img alt="" class="imageRight" src= "/apcsa/r/static/art/scenes/cam_working.png" width="160px" /><p audio="audio3">Constructor bots like toys just as much as 
            humans. One of their favorite toys is a handheld electronic 
            device within which a virtual pet "lives". This pet has <em>moods</em>, such as happiness or pain, and shows these 
            mood through an image and a message on a screen. The owner of  
            the toy can make the pet <em>behave</em> in certain ways.
            And, often, when the pet does something, its mood
            changes.</p>
        <img alt="" class="imageLeft" src="/apcsa/r/static/art/robots/talk_cam_right5.png" /><p audio="audio4">Cam is a young Constructor bot, fresh off the
            assembly line. So, like you, she's just learning to program
            in Java. Cam will be writing a Java program that acts like a
            fully working Virtual Pet toy &mdash; one inside a computer.
            The toy will be better than any she can buy, though, because
            she gets to customize the actions and reactions of thes
            virtual pet.</p>
