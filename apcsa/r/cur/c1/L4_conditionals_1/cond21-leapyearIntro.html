Many computer programs rely on accurate timekeeping procedures to correctly function. Sometimes, a small detail in how a computer keeps
track of the date can lead to huge problems and widespread panic (like in the Y2K scare: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y2K). One of the big issues in counting days
is to make sure that leap years and leap days are accounted for. Handling this issue begins with recognizing when a given year is in fact a leap year.

<p audio="2.m4" A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, unless it's divisible by 100 and not by 400.
2009 isn't a leap year. 2008 was a leap year. 2100 won't be a leap year, and 1900 wasn't either. 
2000 <i>was</i> a leap year.</p>
