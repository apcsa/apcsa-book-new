 <p audio="1"> Here is the definition you read earlier:

 <br /> <br />

 A year is a leap year if it is

 divisible by 4,

 unless it is also divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.

 </p>

 <p audio="2">

 In your own words, define the conditions under which a given year is a leap year.

 How is your definition easier to understand than the definition just given?

        <div name="Nathaniel Hawthorn">A leap year is either only divisible by 4 or 400.
My definition is shorter.

        <div name="sondra">I think it's clearer to find out years that aren't leap years. A nonleap year is either not divisible by 4 or divisible by 100.  All the other years are leap years.

        <div name="Shelly">If a year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.
Otherwise, if it's divisible by 100, it's not a leap year.
Otherwise, if it's divisible by 4, it's a leap year.
Otherwise, it's not a leap year.

I think that this is clearer because it doesn't use the word 'unless'.
