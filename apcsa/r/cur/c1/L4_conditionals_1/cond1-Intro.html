      <title>Motivation for conditional execution</title>

   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="cond1_1">
      Our programs so far have involved three kinds of statements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>assignment statements;</li>
<li>method calls; </li>
<li><tt>return</tt> statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When we call a method from the Object Bench, we know exactly what statements are executed as a result, and exactly what sequence they will be executed.
For example, calling the constructor of the <tt>Refillable</tt> class always executes its three assignment statements in the same order:
</p>
<pre>
   myAmount = initialAmount;  // always executed first
   myUseUpCallCount = 0;      // always executed second
   myTotalUse = 0;            // always executed third
</pre>
      <p audio="cond1_5.m1"> We haven't yet seen a way to sometimes <i>not</i> execute a statement, even though it might not
         make any sense to execute. 
         In the original version of the <tt>Refillable</tt> class, 
         we were not able to <i>validate</i> arguments by handling nonsense values or values that don't make sense
         in the context of the program differently from reasonable values.

         <p audio="cond1_6.f1">
         We'll use <i>conditional execution</i> to handle this.
         It'll also be useful for designing <i>flexible</i> code that can handle
         a variety of reasonable situations.
