Here's a solution to the leap year counting exercise:
</p>

<pre class="width40">    if (year % 400 == 0) {
        leapYearCount = 1;
    } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
        leapYearCount = 0;
    } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
        leapYearCount = 1;
    } else {
        leapYearCount = 0;
    }
</pre> 

<p audio="apply1_2"> 
The code contains four cases, exactly one of which is executed for any particular value 
of <tt>year</tt>.
Applying testing principle 1,
we must test this code with at least one <tt>year</tt> value per case, 
so at least four values of <tt>year</tt> are needed for testing:

Complete the <tt>LeapYearTester</tt> class in <tt>lesson4/LeapYearTester</tt>, and run it in BlueJ.  Your tests should include the following.
</p>
<ul> 
<li audio="apply1_3">a year that's divisible by 400;</li> 
<li audio="apply1_4">a year that's divisible by 100 but not by 400;</li> 
<li audio="apply1_5">a year that's divisible by 4 but not by 100;</li> 
<li audio="apply1_6">a year that's not divisible by 4.</li> 
</ul>
