An elaboration of principle 1 addresses the need to test various <i>paths</i> VOCAB through the program.
Here are examples of path counting in a program segment with two top-level statements.
<ul> 
<li><p> 
There is just one path through two assignment statements.
</p> 
</li> 
<li><p> 
There are two paths through an assignment statement followed by an <tt>if</tt>: 
the path corresponding to a successful test, 
and the path corresponding to an unsuccessful test.
</p> 
</li> 
<li><p> 
Now consider <i>two</i> consecutive <tt>if</tt> statements:
</p> 
<pre>    if ( ... ) {
    }
    if ( ... ) {
    }
</pre> 
<p> 
There are two possibilities for each test, success or failure. 
Thus there are four paths through the two statements, corresponding to the four possibilities
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>success, success</li> 
<li>success, failure</li> 
<li>failure, success</li> 
<li>failure, failure</ll> 
</ul> 
</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
This explains why one test was insufficient to exercise all the code in 
</p> 
<pre>    leapDay = 0;
    if (year % 4 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    }
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        leapDay = 0;
    }
    if (year % 400 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    }
</pre> 
<p> 
From the previous discussion, we see a need for <i>eight</i> tests, 
corresponding to the eight paths through the three tests. 
They are listed below.  We form the entire table, then remove the tests that are logically impossible:
<ul> 
<li><tt>year % 4 == 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 == 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 == 0</tt> (which just means that <tt>year % 400 == 0</tt>)</li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 == 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 == 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 != 0</tt></li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 == 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 != 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 == 0</tt> (not possible)</li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 == 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 != 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 != 0</tt></li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 != 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 == 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 == 0</tt> (not possible)</li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 != 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 == 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 != 0</tt> (not possible)</li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 != 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 != 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 == 0</tt> (not possible)</li> 
<li><tt>year % 4 != 0</tt>, <tt>year % 100 != 0</tt>, and <tt>year % 400 != 0</tt> (equivalently, <tt>year % 4 != 0</tt>)</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
This leaves the four tests we needed for the earlier version.
