We saw that there are often several ways to code a set of conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>consecutive conditional statements</li>
<li>cascaded conditional statements</li>
<li>nested conditional statements</li>
</ul>
<p>
The program logic can get quite complicated.  One way to get evidence that the code works correctly is to test it.
Thorough testing includes making sure that every statement gets executed; if a statement isn't executed, we have no evidence of its correctness.
</p>
<p>
Conditional statements complicate things even more.  Where practical, test cases should exercise every <i>path</i> through the program.
Use of a "tester class" can simplify the testing process.
</p>
<p>
<i>Boundary values</i>&mdash;values that are as large or as small as possible&mdash;are good candidates for tests.  These address typical errors that programmers make, such as off-by-one errors.
