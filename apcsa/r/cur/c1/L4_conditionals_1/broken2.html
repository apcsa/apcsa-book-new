            Objects in programming break too. 
            One way this happens is because of <span class="vocab" term="bug">bugs</span>,
            internal flaws in a program.
            (We'll revisit bugs and how to find and get rid of them in a little while.)

            Sometimes, however, the breakage arises from <i>misuse</i>
            of the object&mdash;for instance, using any convenient round
            object as a bowling ball, even if that round object had a different original purpose.
