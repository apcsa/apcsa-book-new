      <p audio="p2a_1">Here are examples of path counting in various program segments:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <span audio="p2a_2">For an assignment statement such as</span>
            <pre class="width40">   x = 3;</pre>
            <span audio="p2a_3">there is obviously only one path that execution can take.  When there 
               are multiple assignment statements in a row, such as</span> 
            <pre class="width40">   x = 3;
   y = 12;
   result = "Checkmate!";</pre>
            <span audio="p2a_4">there is still only one path: the statements are executed in order.</span>
         </li>
