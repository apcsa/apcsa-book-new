Here's a modification to the <tt>useUp</tt> method from the <tt>Refillable</tt> class.
The first line now checks if the current value of <tt>myAmount</tt> is less than the argument, <tt>amount</tt>, passed to the <tt>useUp</tt> method.
If <tt>myAmount&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;amount</tt> evaluates to true&mdash;has the answer "yes"&mdash;the body of the <tt>if</tt> statement is executed, an error message is printed and <tt>amount</tt> is set to zero.
</p> 
<pre class="width70">
   void useUp (int amount) {
      if (myAmount &lt; amount) {
         System.out.println ("not enough left");
         amount = 0;
      }
      myAmount = myAmount - amount;
   }
</pre> 
<p audio="cond2a_2"> 
This is the first place we've seen where statements can be <i>skipped</i>.
The <tt>if</tt> statement is executed as follows.
</p> 

<ol> 
	<li audio="cond2a_3"> 
The comparison is evaluated: <tt>myAmount</tt> is compared to <tt>amount</tt>, 
	and the answer will be true if <tt>myAmount</tt> is less than <tt>amount</tt> and false otherwise.

</li> 
	<li audio="cond2a_4"> 
If evaluation produces a true result, the statements for a true result are executed.

</li> 
	<li audio="cond2a_5">
Otherwise those statements are skipped and execution continues on the line directly following the <tt>if</tt> block.

</li> 
</ol>
