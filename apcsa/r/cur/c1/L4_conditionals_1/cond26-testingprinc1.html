      <title>Testing principle 1</title>

<p> 
The most obvious principle of program testing is that test values 
must "exercise" every statement in the program,
since any statement that's not tested may contain a bug.
Our tests of the <tt>Refillable</tt> class basically did that, 
covering the cases in <tt>useUp</tt> and the cases in <tt>refill</tt>.
As in the testing of <tt>Refillable</tt>, 
exercising all statements may require more than one run of a program.
<!--  make sure we actually tested refillable like this!  -->

</p> 
<p> 
Recall the leap year tester from an earlier exercise:</p>
<pre>    if (year % 400 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    } else if (year % 100 == 0) {
        leapDay = 0;
    } else if (year % 4 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    } else {
        leapDay = 0;
    }
</pre> 
<p> 
The code contains four cases, exactly one of which is executed for any particular value 
of <tt>year</tt>.
Thus we must test this code with at least one <tt>year</tt> value per case, 
so at least four values of <tt>year</tt> are needed for testing:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a year that's divisible by 400;</li> 
<li>a year that's divisible by 100 but not by 400;</li> 
<li>a year that's divisible by 4 but not by 100;</li> 
<li>a year that's not divisible by 4.</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
Principle 1 by itself is insufficient, however.
Here's an example;
</p> 
<pre>    leapDay = 0;
    if (year % 4 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    }
    if (year % 100 == 0) {
        leapDay = 0;
    }
    if (year % 400 == 0) {
        leapDay = 1;
    }
</pre> 
<p> 
A <tt>year</tt> value of 2000 causes all the statements in this program segment to be executed.
