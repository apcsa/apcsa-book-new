      <p audio="p2_1">An elaboration of principle 1 addresses the need to test various <span class="vocab" term="path">paths</span> through the program.  A path is a sequence of specific statements in a program that a particular
         execution of that program might involve.  A program can
         have many possible paths, especially if it uses conditional statements.
If practical, every <i>path</i> in the program should be tested.</p>
