Why are we using curly brackets when they're not needed?
There are several reasons.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consistency: If we use curly brackets all the time, we don't have to think about when to use them and when not to use them.
Our brains are thus less cluttered.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ease of modification: We often have to add statements in an <tt>if...else</tt> statement, for example, to produce debugging output. If we're adding a statement to an <tt>if...else</tt> body with only one statement and curly brackets not used, we have to insert a <i>pair</i> of curly brackets along with the new statement.  Though it may not seem like a  big deal, it's one extra thing to forget.
