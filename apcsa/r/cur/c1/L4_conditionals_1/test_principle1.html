         <p audio="testp1_1.m1">The most obvious program testing principle is that test values 
            must "exercise" every statement in the program, 
            since any statement that's not tested may contain a bug.

            The animations in previous steps basically did that for the <tt>Refillable</tt> class's <tt>useUp</tt> and <tt>refill</tt> methods. 
            And as we saw, exercising all statements may require more than one run of a program.</p>
