         <p audio="lpyr_1.f1">For the next few activities, we'll be working with code to identify <i>leap years</i>.</p>
      </div>
      <p audio="lpyr_2">Our calendar is set up so that its length matches the time 
         for the earth to move around the sun as closely as possible.  
         The reason is that we want the two to be consistent; 
         we don't want cold weather to be in December some years and June some others.</p>
      <p audio="lpyr_3">It turns out that it takes 365.2424 days for the earth to move around the sun. 
         A year with 365 days would be too short. 
         Thus we have "leap years" in which we add an extra day (the "leap day" February 29); 
         in most years, this happens when the year is divisible by 4.
         That gives an average of 365.25 days in a year, which is slightly too long.</p>
      <p class="redflag" audio="lpyr_4">The rule for leap years handles this by eliminating some of the years divisible by 4: 
         a year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4, 
         unless it is also divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.</p>
