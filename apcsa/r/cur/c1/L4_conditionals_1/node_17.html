Fill in the blanks in the program segment on the right so that it has exactly
the same effect as the one on the left.
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
if (n == 0) {
   icode = icode + 3;
} else {
   icode = icode + 2;
}
</pre>

<td valign="top">

icode = _______________ ;
if (n == 0) {
   icode = _______________ ;

</table>

<li>
<p>
Do the same for the following program segment.
</p>
<pre>
if (n &gt;= 2) {
   n = 2 * n;
}
if (n &gt;= 4) {
   n = n - 2;
}
</pre>
<pre>
if ( ______________________________ ) {
   n = _________________________________ ;
}
</pre>

<p>
Provide the code for a <tt>Weight</tt> class that represents a weight expressed in pounds and ounces.
Your class should provide the following public operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
a constructor with one <tt>int</tt> argument, a nonnegative number
of ounces that's between 0 and 15;
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
a constructor with two <tt>int</tt> arguments, a nonnegative number
of pounds and a value for ounces that's between 0 and 15;
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
a <tt>boolean isHeavier</tt> method with one <tt>Weight</tt> argument that returns <tt>true</tt> if this <tt>Weight</tt> object is heavier than the argument and <tt>false</tt> otherwise;
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
a <tt>multiple</tt> method that, given a positive <tt>int</tt> argument, returns a new <tt>Weight</tt> object that results from multiplying the integer by the represented weight (e.g. multiplying 1 pound 9 ounces by 3 gives 4 pounds 11 ounces;
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
a <tt>print</tt> method that prints this <tt>Weight</tt> object as "<tt>n pounds m ounces"</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is a nonnegative integer and <tt>m</tt> is an integer between 0 and 15, inclusive.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You may define additional private methods.
The constructors are the only methods that should change the internal information in the <tt>Weight</tt> object to which they are applied.
</p>
<p>
There are 16 ounces in a pound. Your code need not do any error checking.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Design a tester class to test the <tt>Weight</tt> class,
and describe what additional evidence each test provides about the correctness of your code.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Write a method named <tt>category</tt> that returns a <tt>String</tt>, given a positive integer argument named <tt>height</tt>, does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
if <tt>height</tt> is less than 60, <tt>category</tt> returns the string "short";
</li>
<li>
if <tt>height</tt> is at least 60 but less than 80, <tt>category</tt> returns the string "medium";
</li>
<li>
if <tt>height</tt> is greater than or equal to 80,
<tt>category</tt> returns the string "tall".
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Your method should perform as few comparisons as possible. 
Also, the first comparison it should make is
</p>
<pre>
   if (height &lt; 80) ...
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If <tt>b</tt> is a boolean variable, then what is the effect
of  the assignment
</p>
<pre>
   b = (b == false);
</pre>
</li>
