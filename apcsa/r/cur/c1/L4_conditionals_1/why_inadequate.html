Principle 1 by itself is insufficient, however.

Here's an example;

</p> 

<table>

<tr>

<td>

<pre>
leapDayCount = 0;
if (year % 4 == 0) {
 leapDayCount = 1;
}
if (year % 100 == 0) {
 leapDayCount = 0;
}
if (year % 400 == 0) {
 leapDayCount = 1;
}
</pre> 

</td>

</tr>

</table><br />

<p audio="2"> 

Given a value of 2000 in <tt>year</tt>,

the code correctly produces a value of 1 for <tt>leapDayCount</tt>,

A value of 2000 in <tt>year</tt> also causes <i>all</i>

the statements in this program segment to be executed. 

</p> 

<p audio="3"> 

As it happens, this code works correctly. 

But a single test doesn't provide much evidence of that.

Provide a small change that would not affect its behavior for a <tt>year</tt> value of 400 

but would produce incorrect behavior for other <tt>year</tt> values.
