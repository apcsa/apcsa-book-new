<p>
Java has two builtin constants that represent yes and no:
<tt>true</tt> means yes, and <tt>false</tt> means no.
The following are equivalent statements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"evaluates to <tt>true</tt>" is the same as "gets the answer 'yes'"</li>
<li>"evaluates to <tt>false</tt>" is the same as "gets the answer 'no'"</li>
</ul>
