            We've seen that supplying invalid arguments to an object's methods can break it. 
            If these invalid arguments came from humans, humans make mistakes. 
            Users of our programs will probably be happy to be reminded
            that they're using our code incorrectly.

        <p class="step" audio="broke8_5">
            In subsequent steps, we will print error messages when we detect object breakage or nonsense calls.
            Even if a given method call causes BlueJ to produce an error message,
            our messages will usually be better than BlueJ's.

            Broken objects probably will produce wrong answers.
            There's a phrase for this: "garbage in, garbage out".
            That is, a method that's given invalid arguments ("garbage in") is
            likely to produce nonsense as a result ("garbage out").
