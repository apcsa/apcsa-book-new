      <p audio="cond5_1">Java also provides a facility for executing one section of code if the result of a comparison 
         is true, and another section of code if the result of the comparison is false. 
         It's called an <tt>if...else</tt> statement.
         Here is its format.</p>
		 
      <pre class="width50">if (<i>comparison</i>) {
   <i>statements for a true result</i> 
} else {
   <i>statements for a false result</i> 
}
</pre>


      <p audio="cond5_2">It's executed as follows.</p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="cond5_3">
            The comparison is evaluated.
         </li>
         <li audio="cond5_4">
            If it's true, the statements for a true result are executed 
            and the statements for a false result are skipped.
         </li>
         <li audio="cond5_5">
            If it's false, the statements for a true result are skipped and
            the statements for a false result are executed.
         </li>
      </ol>
