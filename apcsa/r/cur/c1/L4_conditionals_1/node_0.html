<title>The meaning of "broken"</title>

</head>

<p>
A "broken" object is one whose instance variables contain invalid values.
For example, if the <tt>myAmount</tt> variable in a <tt>Refillable</tt> object contained the value <tt>"xyz"</tt>, that object would be "broken",
since it doesn't make any sense for <tt>myAmount</tt> to be a string.
