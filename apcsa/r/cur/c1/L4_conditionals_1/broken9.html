            In order to thwart attempts to break a <tt>Refillable</tt>
            object, 
            we will insert <span class="vocab" term="error check">checks</span>
            for illegal or not valid argument values.
            A typical pattern will be the following:
        </p>
        <p class="quoteBrown" audio="broke9_2">
            If argument is not valid, then print an error message. 
            <br/>
            Otherwise perform the appropriate action or computation.
        </p>
        <p audio="broke9_3">
            Printing an error message will be done with the method <tt>System.out.println</tt>.
            (There are other ways to deal with invalid arguments that we'll learn
            about later in the course, but printing an error message will do for now.) 
            Checking for an invalid argument is done with <span class="vocab" term="conditional statement">conditional statements</span>,
            which we'll learn about shortly.
