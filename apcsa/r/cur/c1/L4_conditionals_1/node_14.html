We started this lesson by observing a deficiency in the programming done thus far.  Namely, there was no way to <i>selectively</i> evaluate statements in a program.  Here's an example of what we want to do:
</p>
<pre>
public Refillable (int amount) {
   // check that amount is at least 0
   // if not, print an error message
   // otherwise initialize instance variables
}
</pre>
<p>
Java's conditional statement solves this problem.  Its general format is as follows.
</p>
<pre>
if (<i>yes-or-no question</i>) {
   <i>sequence of statements to execute if the answer is yes</i>
} else {
   <i>sequence of statements to execute if the answer is no</i>
}
</pre>
Exactly one of the statement sequences is executed, depending on the answer to the yes-or-no question; the other sequence is skipped.
</p>
<p>
A special case is when there are <i>no</i> statements to be executed if the answer is no:
</p>
<pre>
if (<i>yes-or-no question</i>) {
   <i>sequence of statements to execute if the answer is yes</i>
}
</pre>
<p>
We used conditional statements to make sure that the arguments to the <tt>Refillable</tt> methods all are reasonable.
