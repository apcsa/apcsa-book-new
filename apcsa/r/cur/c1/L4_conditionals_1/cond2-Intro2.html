            A <span class="vocab">conditional statement</span>
            (also called an "<tt>if</tt>" statement) lets us
            decide to skip some statements in a program.
It asks a question&mdash;the "condition". 
            If the answer to the question is yes, the body of the <tt>if</tt> statement is executed; if the answer is no, then the body of the <tt>if</tt>
            statement is skipped. 
        </p>
<pre>
   if (<i>yes-or-no question</i>) {
      statements for the answer yes;
      these are <i>skipped</i> if the answer is no;
   }
</pre>
