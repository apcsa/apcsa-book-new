Both the test principles discussed so far focused on testing features of the code. 
Since they assume that we can see into the program, 
these techniques are collectively referred to as <i>glass-box</i> testing VOCAB.

<p> 
Another testing approach is called <i>black-box</i> testing VOCAB. 
It involves generating test cases based only on the problem <i>specification</i>, 
not on the code itself.
There are several big advantages of this approach:</p>

<ul> 
<li><p> 
The test generation is not <i>biased</i> by knowledge of the code.  
For instance, a program author might mistakenly conclude that a given situation 
is logically impossible and fail to include tests for that situation; 
a black-box tester would be less likely to fall into this trap.
</p> 
</li> 
<li><p> 
Since black-box tests are generated from the problem specification, 
they can be used without change when the program <i>implementation</i> is modified.
</p> 
</li> 
<li><p> 
The results of a black-box test should make sense to someone unfamiliar with the code.
</p> 
</li> 
<li><p> 
Black-box tests can be easily designed before the program is written.

</ul> 
<p> 
Black-box testing goes hand in hand with test-driven development.
