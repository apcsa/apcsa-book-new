 Consider an advanced alarm clock that can have different alarm sounds, 
 such as a radio, a buzzer, an mp3 of Pavorati yodelling, etc. 
 Compared to the simple alarm clock what changes would this 
 advanced clock need?</p>

 No, the behavior "sound the alarm" is still the only action that needs
 to be performed. This behavior will change in the specifics (i.e., it
 needs to figure out what to sound), but it is still a single action.

 The alarm clock will need to store information about which alarm sound
 should be used. This variable might be called "alarm sound".

 No, this alarm clock would need more information about which alarm sound
 should be used. So, it would require an additional variable.

 <span audio="5">It would need both more variables and more behaviors</span>
 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">
 No, there is still only a single behavior that this alarm clock needs:
 "sound the alarm". It does need to store additional information about
 the alarm sound to be used.

        <div class="feedback">
 No, this advanced alarm clock is very similar to the simpler version we
 discussed earlier. An additional variable, called something like "alarm
 sound", should be the only change necessary.
