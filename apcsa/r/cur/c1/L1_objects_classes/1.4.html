            <p audio="1">Each variable has a name and a value.</p>
            <p audio="2">Behaviors are actions that the object can perform; state consists of information (variables) that the object can remember.</p>
        </div>
        <p audio="3">An alarm clock has to be pretty good at <em>remembering</em> when it will do the "ring the alarm" behavior, 
            or it would be a very poor alarm clock.  
            Each object, either in the real world or in programming, needs to have a <em>memory</em>. </p>
        <p audio="4">The way to have memory in object-oriented programming is to create a set of information items 
            associated with a programming object. 
            We call each of these a <span class="vocab">variable</span>. </p>
        <p audio="5">A programming object can keep track of many different pieces of information 
            by containing many different variables.  
            We refer to each variable by its <span class="vocab">name</span>. 
            Each variable will also have a <span class="vocab">value</span>, the thing that is being remembered. 
            Taken together, the set of information is called the object's <b>state</b>.</p>
        <p audio="6">The alarm clock object should have a variable named <i>alarm time</i>, 
            which could take a value such as "5 am", or "8:45 am", or basically any time.  
            The behavior "ring the alarm" needs to know the value of that piece of information in order to work properly. 
            Similarly, the behavior "set the alarm time" needs to change the value of that piece of information  
            in order to work properly. </p>
        <div audio="7" class="quoteBlue">
            A rule of thumb in programming: behaviors generally don't change, but information often will.
