        <h3 audio="1">Methods are "called" in Java</h3>
        <p audio="2">Methods are performed  by being <span class="vocab" term="call">called</span>.
            This might happen as the result of an event, say, a keystroke being typed, a mouse clicked or moved, or a button pressed.
            Methods may also call other methods.</p>
        <p audio="3">A <span class="vocab">constructor</span> method is called when an object is first created. When the method is performed&mdash;<span class="vocab" term="execute">executed</span> is the technical  term&mdash;its statements are executed in the sequence they appear in the method's body, except in the following situations. </p>
        <ul>
            <li audio="4">
                When a method calls another method, the called method's first statement is the next one to be executed.
            </li>
            <li audio="5">
                A special kind of statement, called a <em>conditional statement</em>,
                allows statements to be selectively executed.  
                We'll look into conditional statements later in the course.
            </li>
            <li audio="6">
                Another special kind of statement, called a <em>repetition</em>,
                allows statements to be repeated.  
                We'll also look into repetition statements later in the course.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="7">A method may also <span class="vocab">return</span> information to the method that called it.</p>
        <p audio="8">We'll see an example of method calls in the next few steps.</p>
