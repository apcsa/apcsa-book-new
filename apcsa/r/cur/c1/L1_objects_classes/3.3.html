        Some real-world information is easy to represent directly
        in a program. For example, a person's age may be represented
        as a number; a name may be represented as a string; and 
        sex as a "female" or "male". 
    </p>
    <p audio="2">
        Other
        real-world information can be broken down into things that
        are easy to represent. An example is a person's birthday, which can be represented as a Month and Date in the month.
    </p>
    <p audio="3">
        Sometimes there's more than one representation for a
        given piece of information. A person's phone number or Social
        Security number can be represented either as a number or
        as a string. A reason for using strings for those values is that most people include punctuation when they write a Social Security number or phone (for example, "(800) 555-1212").

        Some information isn't at all easy to
        represent&mdash;such as a person's driving skill.
