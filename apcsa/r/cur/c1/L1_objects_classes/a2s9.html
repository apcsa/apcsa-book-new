      <p audio="2">Programming is best learned by doing it, not simply
      watching or hearing someone talk about it.</p>

      <p audio="3">You'll spend most of your time in this course actually
      programming. In the first few weeks you'll get up to speed
      learning new vocabulary and concepts. Towards the end you'll
      spend most of your time writing real programs that do
      sophisticated things.</p>

      <p audio="4">Professional programmers use special systems called <span
      class="vocab" term="development environment">development environments</span> 
      to speed their
      coding. In this course, you'll use the <em>BlueJ</em>
      development environment, a simple yet relatively powerful
      system written especially for introductory programming
      courses.</p>

      <p audio="5">The BlueJ system isn't contained in the UCCP Course window
      -- it runs as a separate application on your computer. As you
      work through this course you will switch regularly between
      the UCCP and BlueJ windows.</p>

      <div class="quoteBrown">
         <p audio="6">Note: BlueJ must be installed in order to run this
         course. We'll take a closer look at the BlueJ System in
         the next lesson.</p>
