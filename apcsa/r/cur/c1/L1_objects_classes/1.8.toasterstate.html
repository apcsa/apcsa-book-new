<p audio="1">Think about another real world object: a regular, two-slice toaster.
 What kinds of behaviors and state capture how a toaster operates?</p>

<p audio="2">Starting with behaviors is sometimes easiest.  
The things that people need to do, or have the toaster do,
when they are using it include:

<ul>
<li audio="3">insert bread in slot 1 or in slot 2
</li>

<li audio="4">start toasting

</li>
<li audio="5">stop toasting
</li>

<li audio="6">pop up the bread
</li>
<li audio="7">remove the bread from slot 1 or slot 2.
</ul>

<p audio="8">Another behavior concerns how dark the toaster is supposed to make the bread. 
<ul>

<li audio="9">set the bread darkness indicator

</li>
</ul>
