    <div class="prompt">
 <p audio="advancedA1">The best design for our simple alarm clock 
 involved the behaviors "ring the alarm" and "set the alarm time" and the variable 
 "alarm time". But what behaviors and states would be needed 
 to design a more sophisticated alarm clock? </p>
 
 <p audio="advancedA2">Consider a more advanced alarm clock that includes 
 a calendar. This new alarm clock can be set to activate 
 at any time on any day within a year. Compared to 
 the simple alarm clock we were discussing above... </p>

        <div class="text"> <span audio="1">It would need more behaviors to work properly </span> 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback"> The alarm clock doesn't perform any new actions, it just
does the same action at a new time and date. So, in this
more complicated alarm clock, there would still be only a
single behavior "sound the alarm".

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 2">
        <div class="text"> <span audio="2">it would need more variables to work properly </span> 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback"> This advanced alarm clock needs only a single variable, but
the variable needs to store information about the time
<i>and</i> the day that the alarm will go off. If you
choose this answer because you though that should be stored
in two variables (i.e., one for the time and one for the
day), that is also a reasonable answer.

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 3">
        <div class="text"> <span audio="3"> it wouldn't need any additional variables or behaviors </span> 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback"> Right. This calendar alarm clock would still need one
behavior, "sound the alarm", and one variable, although that
should probably be called "alarm timedate" or something. 
That is, the variable needs to store information about the
time <i>and</i> the date.

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 4">
        <div class="text"> <span audio="4"> it would need more variables and more behaviors, but would
make use of behaviors and state from the simple alarm clock </span>
 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback"> This alarm clock would still only need a single behavior,
"sound the alarm", and a single variable, "alarm time and
date", in order to work as described.
