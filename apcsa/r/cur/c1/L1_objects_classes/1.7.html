        <p audio="behaviorstate1">Here is one way to describe an alarm clock: </p>
        <div audio="behaviorstate2" class="quoteBrown">
            "An alarm clock has many different 'sound the alarm' behaviors, 
            one for each possible time that it can sound the alarm. 
            Thus there is a 'sound the alarm at 5am' behavior, a 'sound the alarm at 5:01' behavior, and so forth."
        </div>
        <p audio="behaviorstate3">This description uses no information, only behaviors. The behaviors are quite similar; 
        they're all of the form:</p>
        <div audio="behaviorstate4" class="quoteBrown">
        "Sound the alarm at ______ ."
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p audio="behaviorstate5">Here is a better description that turns the "______" into <em>information</em>:</p>
    <div audio="behaviorstate6" class="quoteOrange">
        "An alarm clock has one 'sound the alarm' behavior, 
        and one variable that remembers what time the alarm should go off."
    </div>
    <p audio="behaviorstate7">The use of the information "what time the alarm should go off" 
        has simplified the clock's description <em>a lot</em>.
        This holds in general: behaviors that use information in the object's state 
        simplifies an object's description.</p>
