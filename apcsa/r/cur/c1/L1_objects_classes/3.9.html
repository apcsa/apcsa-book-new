 Suppose you decided to represent the volume on a portable music player
 as a number. How would you decide what values 
 to choose for the maximum and minimum volume levels?</p>

            I'd want to know the physical capability of the speaker, like its decibel range, then I'd spread the number values across this range.

            I don't get this.  Can't it be any number?  Sort of like the speakers in Spinal Tap that can go to eleven.

        <div name="Joe">A big number, say, 10000, would represent the loudest volume and a small number, say -10000, would represent the smallest volume.

        <div name="Mike">It makes sense to have 0 represent no volume at all and bigger numbers to represent louder volumes.
