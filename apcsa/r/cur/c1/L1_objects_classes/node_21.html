            In the first section of this lesson, we examined one of the first steps that a 
            programmer takes before creating a program:  
            understanding the objects that s/he will write about. 
            There are two important features of  
            objects: <em>behavior</em>
            and <em>state</em>. 
        </p>
        <div class="floatClearLeft" />
            <ul>
                <li audio="2">Behaviors are actions that an object is able to take.   Each behavior has a name that should describe its action. 
                    For the alarm clock, an example was the behavior <strong>sound the alarm</strong>. </li>
                <li audio="3">State is composed of variables, each of which is a piece of information known to the programming object. 
                    Each variable has a name&mdash;what the information is about&mdash;and a value&mdash;the 
                    piece of information itself.  For the alarm clock, an example was named <strong>alarm time</strong>, 
                    which could take a value like <strong>8:15 am</strong>. </li>
            </ul>
            <p audio="4">
                Behaviors and state together provide a way of describing an object. We saw that a description based only on behaviors can be clumsy. 
                A large set of behaviors can often be generalized, using information that's part of the object's state or information  
                that's behavior-specific. The latter kind of information is referred to as a <span class="vocab">parameter</span>. We explored these 
                concepts in several everyday objects (alarm clocks, cell phones, toasters, and MP3 players).
