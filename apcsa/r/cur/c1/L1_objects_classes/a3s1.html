        <p audio="3">That's all for this lesson.  In the next, we'll get started for real.  You'll learn about programming objects and how they relate 
            to things you are familiar with in the real world, like alarm clocks, mp3 players, and calculators. </p>

            Remember, the BlueJ programming environment needs to be installed on the computer (or computers) you will use throughout the course. 
            If you are working in your school lab, your teacher should have already taken care of this.  If you are working from home, or want more information, 
            you can find it in the <a href="page/help/">help area</a>
