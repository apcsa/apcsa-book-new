    <div class="prompt"><p audio="1">Consider an advanced alarm clock that can have different alarm sounds, such as a radio, a buzzer, an mp3 of Pavorati yodeling, etc. Compared to the simple alarm clock, what changes would this advanced clock need?</p>

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 1">
        <div class="text"><span audio="2">It would need more behaviors, but not more variables, to
work properly.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">No, the behavior "sound the alarm" is still the only action that needs
to be performed. This behavior will change in the specifics (i.e., it
needs to figure out what to sound), but it is still a single action.

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 2">
        <div class="text"><span audio="3">It would need more variables, but not more behaviors, to
work properly.</span> 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">The alarm clock will need a behavior that sets up which alarm sound
should be used.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 3">
        <div class="text"><span audio="4">It wouldn't need any additional variables or
behaviors.</span> 
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">No, this alarm clock would need more information about which alarm sound
should be used. It would thus require an additional variable.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 4">
        <div class="text"><span audio="5">It would need both more variables and more behaviors.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">It needs to store additional information about the alarm sound to be
used, along with some way to get that sound into the clock.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 5">
        <div class="text"><span audio="6">It would be a totally different object.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">No, this advanced alarm clock is very similar to the simpler version we
discussed earlier. An additional variable, called something like "alarm
sound", along with a behavior to determine the sound, should be the only
changes necessary.
