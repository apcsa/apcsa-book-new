        <p audio="1">This section introduced how objects will be represented in a Java program. 
            Objects will have <strong>variables</strong>, and the state of these variables will be represented using numeric values,
            text values, Boolean (yes-or-no) values, and combinations of these three.
            Objects will also have <strong>methods</strong> that represent their behaviors.</p>
        <p audio="2">In addition, we took an extended look into a simulation of a program that draws a game board.  You looked at how methods are
            called in a sequence.</p>
