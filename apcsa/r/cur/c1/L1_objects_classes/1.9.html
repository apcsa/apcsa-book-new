 <p audio="1">
 Some of an object's behaviors may be <em>invisible</em>.
 That is, they are obviously happening somehow, but not in a way that a
 person (or program) outside the object can see or can interact with.
 </p>
 <p audio="2">
 For example, a toaster needs to count down the time once it has
 been turned on, but this isn't something a person can see directly.
 </p>
 <p audio="3">
 Describe another invisible behavior of a toaster.
