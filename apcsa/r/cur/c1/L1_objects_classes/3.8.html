    <p audio="1">
 Suppose we want to represent volume on a portable music player 
 (i.e. how loud or soft the music is playing). 
 How would you do this? 
 Can you represent it in more than one way? 
 Explain your answer.</p>

            Well, for detailed information about the state of the volume I'd use a number.

            A number is the best variable for the state of the volume, but I also might use a Boolean to track if this is the Earbud or External Speaker volume setting  (an either/or situation)

        <div name="Joe">I would use a number, with big numbers representing loud and small numbers representing low volume.
