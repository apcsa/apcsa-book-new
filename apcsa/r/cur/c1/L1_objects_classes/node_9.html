        <div class="prompt">
            <p>Suppose we want a more sophisticated alarm clock, one
                that includes a calendar. This new alarm clock can be
                set to activate at any time on any day within a year.
                Along with the clock time, a model of such a clock would
                contain two dates: the clock date and the alarm date.</p>
            <p>List the new behaviors that the new kind of clock
                would require, and explain your answers.</p>
