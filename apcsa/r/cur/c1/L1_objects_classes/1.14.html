            One obvious behavior is making a call.  
			When I type a number into my phone, the send button 
			calls that behavior.  For state, a phone has to know the number 
			I just dialed.

        <div name="Joe">If it has a "vibrate" setting instead of rings, it will need to set and get that setting. The variable contains the value of that setting.
        </div>
        
        <div name="Mike">How about a variable that keeps track of the ring tone? Behavior would be to do that keeping track.

        <div name="nguyen">Keep track of the time of day so it can tell you what time someone called.
