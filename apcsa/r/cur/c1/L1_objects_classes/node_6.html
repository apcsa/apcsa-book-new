A part of the modeling process is choosing which properties of the object are relevant and which are not.
The <b>color</b> of a clock is probably not relevant to its "clockness".
However, whether the time is displayed digitally or with "hands" may be relevant,
depending on what aspects of the clock we wish to model.
