Suppose we want a more sophisticated alarm clock, one that includes
a calendar. This new alarm clock can be set to activate at any time on any day within a year.
</p>
<p>
We can model this enhanced clock as <i>two</i> objects&emdash;a clock and a calendar&emdash;that communicate with each other. Just as the clock's state includes a current time and an alarm time, so will the calendar's state include a current date and an alarm date.
Here are some behaviors.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>clock behaviors</td><td>calendar behaviors</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
compare the alarm time and the clock time
set the clock time
set the alarm time
enable the alarm sound
disable the alarm sound
sound the alarm
tick
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
compare the alarm date and the calendar date
set the calendar date
set the alarm date
add 1 day to the calendar date
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
