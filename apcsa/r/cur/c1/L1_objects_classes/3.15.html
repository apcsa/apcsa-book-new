               Try it out by clicking the <tt><b>Run</b></tt>
               button below. Pay close attention to the sequence in which the various methods
               and statements are executed.

         </li>
         <li audio="2">

            Change the position of the piece, and click <tt><b>Run</b></tt>
            again. 
            What position is row 0, column 0?  Does that make sense? 

      </li>
      <li audio="3">

            Change the color of the board, and click <tt><b>Run</b></tt>
            again.
