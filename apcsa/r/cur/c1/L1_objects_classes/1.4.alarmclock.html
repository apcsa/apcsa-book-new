        <p audio="alarm1">The alarm clock object should have (at least) two variables, one named <i>alarm time</i>, the other named <i>clock time</i>.
            Either could have a value such as "5 am", or "8:45 am", or basically any time.
We've already decided to have a <i>set the alarm time</i> behavior, which
sets the alarm.
A similar behavior, <i>set the clock time</i>, will be appropriate for the clock time.

<!--
            <p audio="alarm2">The behavior "ring the alarm" needs to know the value of the variable <i>alarm time</i> in order to work properly. 
            Similarly, the behavior "set the alarm time" needs to change the value of this variable 
			in order to work properly. </p>
        <div audio="alarm3" class="quoteBlue">
            Behaviors typically drive changes in a variable's value.
