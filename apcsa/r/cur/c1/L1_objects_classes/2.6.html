        <p audio="2">Another class is a playing card. 
            Its instance variables are the card's rank (ace, two, three, ..., ten, jack, queen, king)
            and suit (spades, hearts, diamonds, or clubs).
            Its behaviors include the following:</p>
        <ul audio="3">
            <li>
                Determine if another card has the same rank as this card.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine if another card has the same suit as this card.
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine a given card's value. 
                (For example, jacks and queens and kings all have value 10 in many card games,
                and an ace sometimes has value 1 and sometimes has value 11.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p audio="4">Note the use of card parameters in the card comparison behaviors.</p>
