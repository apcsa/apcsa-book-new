            In the first section of this lesson, we examined one of the first steps that a 
            programmer takes before creating a program:  
            understanding the objects that s/he will write about. 
            There are two important features of  
            objects: <em>behavior</em>
            and <em>state</em>. 
        </p>
        <div class="floatClearLeft" />
            <ul>
                <li audio="2">Behaviors are actions that an object is able to take.   Each behavior has a name that should describe its action. 
                    For the alarm clock, an example was the behavior <strong>sound the alarm</strong>. </li>
                <li audio="3">State is composed of variables, each of which is a piece of information known to the programming object. 
                    Each variable has a name&mdash;what the information is about&mdash;and a value&mdash;the 
                    piece of information itself.  For the alarm clock, an example was named <strong>alarm time</strong>, 
                    which could take a value like <strong>8:15 am</strong>. </li>
            </ul>
            <p audio="4">
                Behaviors and state together provide a way of describing an object. We saw that a description based only on behaviors can be clumsy. 
                A large set of behaviors can often be generalized, using information that's part of the object's state or information  
                that's behavior-specific. The latter kind of information is referred to as a <span class="vocab">parameter</span>. We explored these 
                concepts in several everyday objects (alarm clocks, cell phones, toasters, and MP3 players). 
            </p>

       <p audio="2">Next, we encountered the idea of a <strong>class</strong>&mdash;a sort of blueprint or pattern from which objects with a given behavior and state may be produced.  
            &nbsp;Each object produced from a class is an <strong>instance</strong> of the class.</p>
        <p audio="3">We examined several examples of classes and instances: shoes, online restaurant reservation services,
            sewing patterns and clothes made from them, songs, restaurants, books, and playing cards.</p>
        <p audio="4" class="quoteBlue">We will soon see that every Java program is a collection of classes.
            When run, the program will produce objects that will interact, produce output, and so on.</p>
        <p audio="1">Finally, we encountered objects in Java programs. 
            Objects have <strong>variables</strong>, and the state of these variables will be represented using numeric values,
            text values, Boolean (yes-or-no) values, and combinations of these three.
            Objects also have <strong>methods</strong> that represent their behaviors.</p>
        <p audio="2">In addition, we took an extended look into a program that 
        draws a game board, specifically at how its methods are
            called in a sequence.</p>
