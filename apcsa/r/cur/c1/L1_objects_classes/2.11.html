        <p audio="1">When a program contains two different objects, they can work together to perform complicated tasks. 
            A behavior from one object can call a behavior of the other object, and vice versa.  
            An important and sometimes difficult task in programming 
            is  figuring out how something complicated can be achieved 
            by several simpler objects working together.</p>
        <p audio="2">Consider a  calculator that can add and subtract numbers.  All told, a calculator is a pretty complex thing, even one
            that can only do two kinds of arithmetic.  Breaking it down into two objects make things simpler, however:</p>

        <ul style="margin-left:150px; width:350px;">
            <li audio="3">
                A <strong>keyboard</strong>
                that keeps track of keystrokes typed by the user
                until ENTER is typed.
            </li>
            <li audio="4">
                An <strong>accumulator</strong>
                that, given a sequence of keystrokes provided by the keyboard, 
                can evaluate it (figuring out what the sum or difference is)  
                and either display it or display the <em>accumulation</em>
                of that value with whatever the accumulator
                was storing before.
