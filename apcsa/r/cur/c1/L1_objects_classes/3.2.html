      I would use -1 for no and 1 for yes. Negative should mean no and positive should mean yes.

      Let's see.  I guess 1 for Yes because you have some value, and 0 for No because you've got nada.

      Programmers generally use 0 for no, or "false", and any other number for yes, or "true".  In Java, 
      though, we wouldn't use a number for yes-or-no information in the first place!  That's why
      Java has boolean values...
