 For some applications, a program might include a class named
 <i>restaurant</i>, of which a McDonald's restaurant 
 might be an instance. Describe a situation in which a McDonald's 
 restaurant could be a <em>class</em>, give some instances, 
 and say what its state information would be.

            I am not sure about this.  How can it be a class if it was already an instance?   And McDonald's definitely is not classy. Ha Ha.

            I'd guess McD's could be a class if you're talking about the chain of stores.  So the instances would be:
            -  Franchise X
            -  Franchise Y
            -  Franchise Z
            
            And state information could be things like the Construction Date, the Money Made Per Week, the Total Number of People Served, etc
        
        </div>
        
        <div name="Mike">There are lots of individual McDonald stores, but they all are based on a pattern.  The pattern would be a class. The state information could be the menu, the location, the owner.
