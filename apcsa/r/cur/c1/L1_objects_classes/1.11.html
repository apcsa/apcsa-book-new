        <title>Dealing with similarity in behaviors</title>

        <p audio="1">If you're like most students, your three paragraphs
        were either:</p>
        <ol>
                    <li>Combine strawberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine blueberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine raspberry ice cream with milk in a blender.</li>
        </ol>
        <p audio="2">
        or
        </p><ol audio="3">
                   <li>Combine strawberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine blueberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>
                    <li>Combine raspberries with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender.</li>
                    </ol>
        <p audio="4">Some of you may even have said, "Do the same thing as you just did, except use raspberries (or raspberry ice cream)
            instead of strawberries."</p>
            <p>
            Basically, we have a pattern that combines behavior with information:</p>
        <div class="quoteOrange">
            "To make a ________ milk shake, combine ________ with vanilla ice cream and milk in a blender."
        </div>
        <p audio="5">The information is what flavor milkshake is desired and what fruit
        or flavor of ice cream to use.</p>
        <p audio="6">In the alarm clock example, we represented the similarity information as state variables associated with the object. 
            An alternative is to associate the information only with a particular behavior&mdash;in this case, milk shake making. 
            A piece of information that's used in this relatively minor way is called a <em><span class="vocab">parameter</span></em>.</p>
