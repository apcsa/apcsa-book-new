            This seems hard. We could use "loudest", "least", and "off", but I don't know how to give names to volume levels in between.

            Just names for the conditions. So:  "loudest" "softest"
        
        </div>
        
        <div name="Mike">The empty string could represent "off", and longer strings could represent louder volumes. For example, "x" could be minimmum volume and "xxxxxx...x" (lots of x's) the maximum value.
