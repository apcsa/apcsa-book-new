<p audio="1">Programming objects often represent, or model, real-world objects.</p>

<p audio="2">This course is about a style of programming called <span class="vocab">object-oriented programming</span>.
This term implies a focus on designing programming <u>objects</u>. The most obvious kind of object that a programmer might
write is one that models something in the real world: that is, one that <em>behaves</em> like the thing in the real
world.
By working with the programming object, we may find out information about its real-world counterpart.</p>

<p audio="3">An alarm clock is an example of a thing one can <span class="vocab">represent</span>, or 
<span class="vocab">model</span>, as a programming
object. To make a program that instructs the computer to act like an alarm clock, one would make a programming object that
acts like an alarm clock. All programming objects have names. A good name for this object would be <i>alarm clock</i>.</p>
