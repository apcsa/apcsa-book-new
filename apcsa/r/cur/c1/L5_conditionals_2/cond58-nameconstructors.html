We will add two more constructors, one for a one-word name, the other for a two-word name.
</p> 
<pre class="width50">public Name (String first, String last) {
   myFirst = caseFixed (first);
   myMiddle = "";
   myLast = caseFixed (last);
}

public Name (String first) {
   myFirst = caseFixed (first);
   myMiddle = "";
   myLast = "";
}
</pre>

Why not just retain the three-argument constructor and have the client object
pass empty strings as arguments?  Because we want to present an <i>abstraction</i>
to the client by <i>hiding</i> the details of how names are actually implemented.
