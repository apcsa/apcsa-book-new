Consider the <tt>outranks</tt> method whose header appears below.
</p>
<pre class="width80">
   // Return true if this card outranks the argument, that is,
   // its rank is higher than the argument's rank, or the two 
   // ranks are the same and this card's suit is higher than
   // the argument's suit.
   public boolean outranks (Card c) ...
</pre>
<p audio="node8_2">
Two card objects will be involved in the comparison.
</p>
<ul>
<li audio="node8_3">
One of them is the argument <tt>c</tt>. We can find out the suit
and the rank of <tt>c</tt> by saying <tt>c.suit ( )</tt> and <tt>c.rank ( )</tt>.
</li>
<li audio="node8_4">
The other is "this card", the object whose methods we use when we don't specify a dot: <tt>suit ( )</tt> and <tt>rank ( )</tt>.
The word <tt>this</tt> is used in Java to refer to the current object.
We can optionally use <tt>this</tt> with methods or instance variables to make explicit what object we want:
<tt>this.suit ( )</tt> and <tt>this.rank ( )</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
<p audio="node8_5">
Here's how the <tt>Card</tt> constructor would appear
if we use <tt>this</tt> everywhere it applies.
</p>
<pre class="width80">
   public Card (int rank, int suit) {
      if (this.isLegalRank (rank)) {
         this.myRank = rank;
      } else {
         System.out.println ("Illegal rank: " + rank);
      }
      if (this.isLegalSuit (suit)) {
         this.mySuit = suit;
      } else {
         System.out.println ("Illegal suit: " + suit);
      }
   }
