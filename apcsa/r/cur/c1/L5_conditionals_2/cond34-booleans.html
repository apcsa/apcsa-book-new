                In English, we use words like "and" 
                or "or" to combine expressions.  Float, give us an example.
            </p>
        </div><br />
        <div  class="talkBubble medium_right" char="float8" align="left" color="orange">
            <p audio="cond34boolean_2.m2">
                Ahem. <i>I like playing video games at night or reading and charging my solar panel during the day.</i>
            </p>
        </div> <br />
        <div  class="talkBubble" char="constance1" align="right" color="blue">
            <p audio="cond34boolean_3.f1">
                As you can see, sloppy use of and/or statements can lead to ambiguous meaning. 
                Does Float like gaming at night and reading/solar charging during the day?  
                Or does he like gaming or reading at night, and solar charging during the day? 
            </p>
        </div> <br />
        <div  class="talkBubble small_right" char="twitterton5" align="left" color="green">
            <p audio="cond34boolean_4.m4">
                Ambiguity is <b>not</b>
                acceptable for a programming language
                like Java.  We'll learn how to be very precise with "and/or" and similar expressions, lest the compiler
                scold us!
