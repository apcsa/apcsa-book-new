           Modern programming languages are pretty smart. You may have noticed that, depending on whether the left side of a boolean expression is true or false, one may not need to evaluate the right side. For example:
        </p>
        <p audio="cond34bboolean_2" class="quoteBlue">
            Recall a previous step, where <tt>tempStr</tt> was set to "comfortable" or "uncomfortable" depending on the value of <tt>temp</tt>.
        </p>
               
         <table id="tableClear">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre>if (temp &gt;= 65 &amp;&amp; temp &lt;= 75) {
    tempStr = "comfortable";
} else {
    tempStr = "uncomfortable";
}</pre>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p audio="cond34bboolean_3" class="quoteBrown">
            What happens when <tt>temp</tt> is assigned the value 55? The left-hand side of the statement evaluates to <tt>false</tt> and the right-hand side is skipped. Why?</p>

            <pre class="width50">if (temp &gt;= 65 &amp;&amp; ... ) {</pre>
      <p audio="cond34bboolean_4" class="quoteBlue">
            If <tt>temp</tt> is less than 65, it doesn't matter what the "..." is.
In order for the <tt>and</tt> (<tt>"&amp;&amp;</tt>") expression to evaluate to <tt>true</tt>, both its subexpressions must be true. In our example, as soon as
            the left subexpression evaluated to <tt>false</tt>, we knew the entire expression would be false. The process of cutting short the evaluation of a boolean expression is known as <span class="vocab">short-circuiting</span>.
        </p>
