      <p audio="cond48_1">We'll now consider a class that models a playing card. Examples include
           the ace of spades, 
         or the seven of diamonds.  The standard deck has 52 card, with each of the 
         four suits (spades, diamonds, hearts, and clubs) containing 13 cards each.</p>
    
      <p audio="cond48_2">This class will include instance variables that describe the suit and the rank
         of a card, and will provide methods that allow a card's suit and rank to be determined.</p>
