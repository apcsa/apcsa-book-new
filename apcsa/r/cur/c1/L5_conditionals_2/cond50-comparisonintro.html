      <p audio="cond50_1"> The <tt>Name</tt> class we worked with earlier had two big deficiencies. 
         First, it could only handle names with a first name, a middle name, <i>and</i> a last name.
         Second, there was no easy fix for this problem; supplying a special string of some sort
         for (say) the middle name had undesirable side effects.</p>
      <p class="quoteBrown" audio="cond50_2"> Conditionals allow us to fix this problem by having a special string for each missing
         part of the name, and by checking explicitly for this string when building the full name,
         the initials, etc.
       </p>  

	   
	   <p audio="cond50_3">
         Before we start modifying the <tt>Name</tt> class, we need to provide a few more details about how comparisons
         are made in Java.</p>

         <p>Open up BlueJ, and then the project <tt>lesson5/Names</tt>.  We'll be modifying this class as we move through 
         	the rest of lesson 5.
