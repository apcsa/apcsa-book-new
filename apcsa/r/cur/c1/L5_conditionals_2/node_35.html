<li>
<p>
Write a <tt>boolean</tt> method named <tt>hasSameParity</tt> that, given two <tt>int</tt> arguments, returns <tt>true</tt> if both are odd or both or even; otherwise, it returns <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Assume <tt>n</tt> is an <tt>int</tt> variable that contains some value between 1 and 10,
inclusive. 
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
List the integer values for <tt>n</tt> that satisfy the following boolean expression.
</p>
<pre>
   (n &lt;= 3) || (n &gt; 6)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do the same for the following.
</p>
<pre>
   ! ((n &gt;= 4) || (n &gt; 7))
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do the same for the following.
</p>
<pre>
   ! ((n &lt;= 5) &amp;&amp; (n &gt;= 8))
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Again assume that <tt>n</tt> is an <tt>int</tt> variable that contains some value between 1 and 10,
inclusive.  
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
Which values of <tt>n</tt> satisfy the statement
</p>
<blockquote>
<tt>n</tt> is neither greater than 8 nor less than 3.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Translate the statement in part a to Java.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Consider the following method.
</p>
<pre>
   // Assume that n is between 1 and 10, inclusive.
   // Return true if n is legal (neither greater than 8
   // nor less than 3) and return false otherwise.
   public boolean isLegal (int n) {
      return <u><i>your answer to part b</i></u>;
   }
</pre>
<p>
Give a tester class that calls <tt>isLegal</tt> five times.
Which five arguments will collectively produce the best evidence that <tt>isLegal</tt> works correctly?
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>
Fill in the blanks in the program segment on the right
so that it has exactly the same effect as the one on the left.
</p>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td>
<pre> 
if (n == -1) {
   icode = icode + 2;
}
if (n == -2) {
   icode = icode + 3;
}
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
if ( __________ ) {
   icode = icode + _______________ ;
}
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Write a <tt>boolean</tt> method named <tt>areOnSameDiagonal</tt> that, given <tt>int</tt> arguments <tt>row1</tt>, <tt>col1</tt>, <tt>row2</tt>, and <tt>col2</tt>, returns <tt>true</tt> if the position on a chessboard represented by <tt>row1</tt> and <tt>col1</tt> is on the same diagonal as the position represented by <tt>row2</tt> and <tt>col2</tt>. Otherwise, it should return <tt>false</tt>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Background: the <tt>%</tt> operator produces <i>the integer remainder</i> that results from dividing the first operand by the second. If the second operand is a factor of the first, the division remainder will be 0.
</p>
<p>
The following program segment is intended to print information about which of 2, 3, and 5 are factors of a value named <tt>n</tt>.
For example, if <tt>n</tt> contains 11, then nothing should be printed; if <tt>n</tt> contains an even number, "2 is a factor" should be printed; if <tt>n</tt> is divisible by 6, "2 is a factor" and "3 is a factor" should both be printed.
</p>
<pre>
   if (n%2==0) {
      System.out.println ("2 is a factor");
   } else if (n%3==0) {
      System.out.println ("3 is a factor");
   } else if (n%5==0) {
      System.out.println ("5 is a factor");
   }
</pre>
<p>
It doesn't work correctly.
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
As completely as possible, describe the values of <tt>n</tt> for which the program segment <i>does not</i> produce the correct output.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Making as few changes as possible, fix the bugs.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
If the code were to be modified by adding more cases by filling in the blanks shown below, how many more cases would have to be added to produce correct behavior?
</p>
<pre>
   if (n%2==0) {
      System.out.println ("2 is a factor");
   } else if (n%3==0) {
      System.out.println ("3 is a factor");
   } else if (n%5==0) {
      System.out.println ("5 is a factor");
   } else if ( ___ ) {
      System.out.println ("___ is a factor");
   } else if ( ___ ) {
      System.out.println ("___ is a factor");
   } else if ( ___ ) {
      System.out.println ("___ is a factor");
   } ...
