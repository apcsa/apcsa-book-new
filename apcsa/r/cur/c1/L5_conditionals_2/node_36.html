<title>Relation of "and", "or", and "not"</title>
</head>

<p>
There is a nice relationship between <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt>||</tt>, and <tt>!</tt>. Suppose <tt>b1</tt> and <tt>b2</tt> are boolean variables. Then
</p>
<table>
<tr><td><tt>!(b1 &amp;&amp; b2)</td>
<td>is equal to</td>
<td><tt>!b1 || !b2</tt></td></tr>

<tr><td><tt>!(b1 || b2)</td>
<td>is equal to</td>
<td><tt>!b1 &amp;&amp; !b2</tt></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
That is, negating an "and" gives an "or" with the arguments negated.
Similarly, negating an "or" gives an "and" with the arguments negated.
</p>
<p>
These are called "DeMorgan's Laws", named after a 19th-century mathematician.  You may wish to verify them using an example or a truth table.
