<p audio="cond51_1"> 
We have seen how the <tt>==</tt> operator is used to compare <tt>int</tt> values.</br>
</br>
For example:
<pre class="width30">
int x = 10; int y = 10;
if (x == y) { 
   //do something
} else {
   //do something else
}
</pre>
<p audio="cond51_2">
Here <tt>x == y</tt> "asks", does <tt>x</tt> match <tt>y</tt>? In this case, the answer is <tt>true</tt>&mdash;they are the same number.
</br></br>
However, <tt>==</tt> means something rather different when applied to objects.

Consider this:
</p>

<pre class="width40">
Card c1 = new Card(9,2);
Card c2 = new Card(9,2);
if (c1 == c2) {
   //do something
} else {
   //do something else
}
</pre>

<p audio="cond51_3">
To check that <tt>c1 == c2</tt>, where <tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt> 
each resulted from constructing a <tt>Card</tt> object, asks whether <tt>c1</tt>'s object
<em>is the same object as</em> <tt>c2</tt>'s object. The answer here is <tt>false</tt>; <tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt> are not the same object even though
their <em>content</em>, or instance variables, are the same. How do we compare these objects to see if their contents are same?
</p>
 
<p class="quoteGreen" audio="cond51_4"> 
We rely on a method named <tt>.equals(...)</tt> to make the comparison for us. This gets a little complicated but it
is fairly straightforward with strings. 
Two different <tt>String</tt> objects may contain the same characters in the same sequence,
but comparing them with <tt>==</tt> will fail.
Instead, we use the <tt>equals</tt> method in the <tt>String</tt> class.
Given two <tt>String</tt> variables <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>,
the expression <tt>s1.equals(s2)</tt> has value <tt>true</tt> if <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> contain the same characters
in the same sequence. It returns <tt>false</tt> otherwise.
