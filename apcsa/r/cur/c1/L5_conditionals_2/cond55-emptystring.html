<p audio="cond55_1"> 
There are several ways that a <tt>String</tt> object can be thought of as "empty".
</p> 
<ul> 

<li audio="cond55_2"> 
It might be uninitialized.  A class's constructor is supposed to make sure
that all the class's instance variables are initialized so this situation
shouldn't happen in correct code.
 
</li> 

<li audio="cond55_3"> 
It might not contain any characters at all.  That is, it's <tt>""</tt>, with nothing
between the double quotes.  We call this the <span class="vocab">empty string</span>.
 
</li> 
 
<li audio="cond55_4"> 
It might consist entirely of blanks.  We call this a "blank string".
However, it's not empty, since it contains blank characters.
(Blank characters are quite important.  Imagine how hard it would be to read a book
with all the blank characters removed!) 
</li> 
</ul>
