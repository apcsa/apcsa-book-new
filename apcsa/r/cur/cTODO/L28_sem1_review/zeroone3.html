By now you know that behaviors and states are represented in Java objects as methods and variables. For this exercise, try representing the mouse that you just described as a simple java class.

Include:

<ul>
<li>A class definition for your mouse</li>
<li>A list of variables needed to store the state that you described. Remember to think about what type each variable should be.</li>
<li>Method definitions for each of the behaviors that you described. Be sure to think about parameters that may be needed for these methods!</li>
</ul>

You don't need to worry about filling in your methods -- just the method definitions will do.
