    	<p audio="1">The Monty Hall simulation will not be covered on your AP exam.  However, you will be expected to 
    	be able to read and understand large programs.<br/><br/>To review this skill, go back to your Monty Hall program in BlueJ.
    	Instead of working with the code directly from BlueJ, try printing it out and reading it on paper.  <br/><br/>See if you 
    	can still understand the way the program works.  If not, you should practice this skill with other projects from the course 
    	as well. <br/><br/> Remember:  you won't have a computer to work with during the AP exam!</p>
