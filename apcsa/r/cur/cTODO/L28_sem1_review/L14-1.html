<b>Key Concepts:</b>
<ul>
<li audio="thisislame5">Selection sort involves repeatedly taking the smallest element from an unsorted ArrayList and moving it into a new ArrayList.</li>
<li audio="thisislame6">Insertion sort is like Selection sort, except that elements are takeen from the unsorted ArrayList in a random order and put into a new ArrayList in sorted order.</li>
<li audio="thisislame7">There are many ways to evaluate the efficiency of a program.  The simplist is to count the number or times that a key piece of code is run.  For the sorts, you might count the number of times that a card is moved between ArrayLists.</li>

</ul>
