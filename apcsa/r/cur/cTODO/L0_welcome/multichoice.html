 How long does it take a typical home computer
 to add two big numbers together?

 It can add them together about once a second.

 Computers are much, much faster than this!
 Almost everything a computer does
 involves adding numbers together. Even drawing a
 simple shape can make a computer add hundreds or thousands of numbers
 together.

 It can add them together about 1,000 times a second.

 Computers are faster than this! The UNIVAC,
 first made in 1951, could add
 100,000 ten-digit numbers together each second.

 It can add them together about 100,000,000 times a

 This answer is closest to correct. However, different
 computers can vary widely in their
 computational power. An iPhone may be cool but
 its processor gets owned by a Sun workstation.
 And, even being able to add 100,000,000 numbers a second
 is <b>not</b> instantly; many problems require
 much, much more adding than that.

 All computers have limits, and this will never
 change. It's easy to think up problems that are
 simple to describe but would take a modern computer a century to calculate!
