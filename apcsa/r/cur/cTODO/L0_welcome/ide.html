      <p audio="development1">Professional programmers use special systems 
      called <span class="vocab" term="Development Environment">development
            environments</span> to speed their coding. In this course, 
         you'll use the <span class="help">BlueJ</span> development
         environment, a simple yet relatively powerful system written
         especially for introductory programming courses.</p>
      <p audio="development2">The BlueJ system isn't contained in this Course
         window. Rather, it runs as a separate application on your
         computer. As you work through this course you will switch
         regularly between this window and BlueJ application.</p>
