            In some ways, you can think of this course window 
            like a course guidebook, where you'll spend portions of your time
            reading about programming issues.

            Reading pages are used to:

        <ul>
            <li audio="reading3">Introduce new concepts.  If a concept is particularly important, we'll 
                highlight it in a <i>key concept</i> box over to the right  
                (see <img style="vertical-align:middle;width:16px" src="/apcsa/r/static/art/graphics/special-key-32.png" alt="key icon" />icon).
				</li><li audio="reading4">Explain a new wrinkle, or detail, to a concept that you've been working with for a while.</li>
            <li audio="reading5">Define a new vocabulary word.  New terms, like <span class="vocab">recursion</span>, will be highlighted 
                and appear as a dynamic link in a <i>vocabulary</i> box <br/>
                (see <img style="vertical-align:middle;width:16px" src="/apcsa/r/static/art/graphics/special-dictionary-32.png" alt="dictionary icon" /> icon)
                 to the right.  Click any vocabulary link in the box to see its definition in the Course Glossary.</li>

            We'll keep these reading pages as short as possible. 
            But keep in mind that they generally contain  
            important information, so don't skip them just to jump ahead 
            to the assignments.
