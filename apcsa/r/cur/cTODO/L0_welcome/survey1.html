            Occasionally, you'll take a survey. 
            Survey questions are similar  
            to the other kinds of questions you've 
            seen so far, but they don't  
            have a correct answer.  They're a way to convey feedback to your teacher or course facilitator.

            Surveys will generally consist of multiple 
            questions, and will appear over multiple "sub" pages.  Be sure to use the green "Next" arrow to move
            between these subpages pages so that you don't miss any.
        </p>

            You are currently on part 1 of the survey.  You can see from the title 
            at the top of the window that this survey has 5 parts. 
            Click the green "Next" arrow to move to part 2.
