    <div class="prompt"> <p audio="surveyE1">The "Turing Test" refers to a contest to tell the difference between a 
 human and a computer pretending
 to be human. The test involves text-only responses
 to written questions. For example: imagine receiving a series of email replies from "Stranger A"
 and "Stranger B" knowing one of them was actually a computer imitating a human.</p>
 
 <p audio="surveyE2"> 
 The Turing Test examines 
 a computer's ability to demonstrate "artificial" (human-like) intelligence. 
 Or, really, how good programmers are at writing a 
 computer program that can read messages and write convincing replies. 
 </p>
 
 <p audio="surveyE3">While computers can sometimes be quite convincing, no computer AI (artificial intelligence) so far 
 has passed a real Turing Test. Do you think it will happen, and when?</p>

        <div class="text">If programmers put a lot of effort into it, they could do it in a few
months or a year. Current computers are fast enough, and
programmers are smart enough already.

        <div class="feedback">Really!! Computer Scientists have been trying for years.

anyone.

computers apart from humans.
