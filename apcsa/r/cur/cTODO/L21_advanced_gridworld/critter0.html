Part 4 of the case study introduces the <tt>Critter</tt> class.
The kinds of actors we encountered earlier all merely looked at the grid
to determine where to move.</p>

<p class="quoteBlue" audio="3"><tt>Critters</tt> first gather a list of interesting actors,
then they <i>process</i> the actors in the lists
(and possibly move as well, 
with the movement determined somehow from the other actors).
