<b>Key Concepts:</b>
<ul>
<li>An abstract class can't be instantiated, but it can be extended.</li>
<li>A class with abstract methods has to be declared as abstract.</li>
<li>A subclass that provides definitions for the superclass's abstract methods can be instantiated.</li>
<li>An interface has all abstract methods and no instance variables.</li>
<li>Classes can implement an interface by providing definitions for all of its methods.</li>
<li>An interface specifies a contract for a class that implements the interface, which then can be relied upon to supply the relevant methods for users of the class.</li>
<li>Static variables are associated with classes rather than objects.  All instances of a given class share that class's static variables.</li>
</ul>
