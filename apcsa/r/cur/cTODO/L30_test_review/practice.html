The best thing you can do now is to take a practice version of the AP exam.  If you're taking this 
course in a classroom, your teacher will provide you with one or more practice tests.  If you're taking this 
course online, you can find practice exams in the AP Computer Science Course Description and on the College Board's website.
<br/><br/>
You should take at least one of these exams now and see how you do.  Take as many practice exams as you can between now and 
the real thing -- practice makes perfect!
