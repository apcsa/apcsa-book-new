      <title>Sampling sound is a way to keep a record of it</title>

         What a sound is, then, is characterized by 
         the quickly varying pressure in the air.  To keep a  
         record of a sound is keep a record of the pressure. 
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         The most common way to keep a record of the pressure is 
         to take many, many individual measurements in rapid 
         succession.  As typically stored on compact 
         discs, for instance, each measurement is stored as 
         an integer, varying between &ndash;32768 and 32767.  This 
         number is called an <span class="vocab">individual sample</span>.  
         The size
         of this number is directly related to the amount of pressure 
         in the air: the bigger the value of the sample, 
         the higher the pressure
         that's recorded.  Java could measure the pressure with much 
         more precision than this, but experience shows that 
         this range is usually good enough.

         How quickly are samples taken?  For compact discs, there
         are 44,100 samples taken every second.  This is called the <span class="vocab">sampling rate</span>, and the quality
         of the recorded sound is quite dependent on it.  In this lesson,
         we'll use a sampling rate of 22,050, exactly half that used
         on compact discs.  (Your teacher, or you, may change this default
         depending on how fast your computer is.)
      </p>
      <p audio="5" class="quoteBrown">
         So, one second of sampled sound is, as far as your computer is 
         concerned, a collection of about 22,000 integers. We'll use 
         <tt>ArrayList</tt>s to store this.
