         Let's check out some sounds in Java. 
      </p>
      <div class="openbluejproj" project="lesson13/Sound">
         <p audio="1">
            Open the current project in BlueJ (<b>lesson13/Sound</b>).
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="3">
         The project in BlueJ contains several classes, but you only need 
         to pay attention to the <tt>Sound</tt>
         class.  This is where 
         you will add your methods to transform the sound (methods 
         like <tt>addReverb</tt>
         and<tt>increaseVolume</tt>, for example). 
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         Before looking at the code for the <tt>Sound</tt>
         class, let's 
         look at a sound:
      </p>
      <div class="imageRight">
         <img src="/apcsa/r/static/art/screenshots/sound_viewer.png"
              alt="A picture of a sound waveform">
      </div>
      <p audio="5" class="step">
         Right-click on the <tt>Sound</tt>
         class to create a new instance. 
         You will see three different constructors.  For now, choose the 
         one with the <tt>String filename</tt>
         argument&mdash;use this 
         one any time you know the name of the file you want to open 
         and can type it as a string.
      </p>
      <p audio="5b" class="step">
         Type in, exactly, <tt>"sounds/birdcall.wav"</tt> when BlueJ
         asks you for the argument.  Note: you need to include those double
         quotation marks at the beginning and the end.  You are making a 
         Java <tt>String</tt> object.
      </p>

      <p audio="6">
         You new window will pop up containing a very jagged image, something like
         the image to the right.  This is the 
         sound viewer, and shows the pressure waves  for the sound.
         You can think of it as a viewer of ArrayLists&mdash;very large ArrayLists 
         containing integers&mdash;because that is the same thing as
         pressure waves, as far as we are concerned!
      </p>
      <p audio="7">
         Click the play button.  You should hear a bird call.  If you don't,
         make sure the volume setting in your computer is loud enough.
