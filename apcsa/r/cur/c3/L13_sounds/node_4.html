            So what is all this casting anyway? I am not in show business.

Yeah, no kidding Float. Didn't you read the code?  We are trying to amplify the sound by 20% which requires us to multiply every value in the sound wave by 1.2. You know what happens when you multiply an integer by a double?

           Yes, of course. You get a double. What gives?

          <div class="talkBubble medium_right" char="raster4" color="green" align="right">

Well what gives is that in this case, our ArrayList only stores Integer objects; it can not store doubles. Casting the value back to an integer allows us to store the result of the multiplication in our ArrayList again.

           Ok fine. I am with you. But please tell me it at least rounds correctly. If I multiply by 1.2 and get 3.6, I get 4 right?
         </p>

         <div class="talkBubble medium_right" char="raster4" color="green" align="right">

Actually no. Casting to an integer will truncate, or ignore, the decimal and just grab the whole number. If you want to round you need to use the <tt>Math</tt> class.

          I think I get it. Thanks Raster.
