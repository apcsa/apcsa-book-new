        <div name="Mario">I chose to make my argument a double, and accepted a range between 0 and 1.  0 means no noise, and 1 means complete and total noise!  I used a little math to convert that to a positive or negative number between (at most) -32000 and
+32000.

        <div name="Genovieve">I chose to make addNoise take an int, between -32768 and 32767.  Then, I made a random number bwebetween 0 and that argument.  But, it didn't work quite right, because I didn't get both negative and positive noise!  So, I had to get another random number, either -1 or +1, and then I multiplied by that.  The hardest part was making sure the individual signal didn't get too big or too small.
