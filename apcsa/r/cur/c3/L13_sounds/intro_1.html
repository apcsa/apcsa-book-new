      <p audio="2">
         Taking our cue from the <i>science</i> in <i>Computer Science</i>, let's
         define sound as a physical phenomenon.   We hear sound
         when there are quickly changing waves of pressure in the air.
         Think of a wave as a cycle of high and low pressure.  So, when 
         someone hits a key on a piano, waves of high air pressure radiate 
         outwards.  If you are standing still (or moving at less
         than the speed of sound, about 1100 feet per second), 
         your ears will "feel" the air pressure get higher and lower
         and higher and lower again and again.  
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         These cycles are happening quite quickly, sometimes 
         thousands of times a second.  How quickly the cycles are
         repeating is heard as the <span class="vocab" term="sound frequency">frequency</span>,
         or <span class="vocab" term="sound pitch">pitch</span>,
         of the sound.  The frequency says how high or low the sound is.  The lowest 
         sounds we can hear are cycling on the order of 20-30 times
         per second.  With cycles that slow, you can also feel 
         the sound in your body.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         Another way sounds differ is by how much pressure there is
         in the air or, more precisely, how big a difference there
         is between the highest and the lowest pressure of the air
         within a cycle.  This is called the <span class="vocab" term="amplitude">amplitude</span>.
Big differences in pressure are heard
         as loud sounds; slight differences in pressure are heard as 
         quiet sounds.  And, of course, a constant pressure isn't
         heard at all&mdash;that's complete silence!

         Sound frequency, or pitch, is determined by how quickly 
         the pressure cycles between high and low.
