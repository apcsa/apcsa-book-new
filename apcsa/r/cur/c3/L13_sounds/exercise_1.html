         Implement some of the following additions to the <tt>ReadSound</tt>
         class specified on the previous page.

               Music in which every note is the same duration is ... boring!
               Devise a new type of string that can encode duration
               information.  Mimicking regular musical notation (mostly), these 
               variable length
               notes can come in six possible durations:</span>
			   <ul>
			   	<li audio="4">four times as long as the regular length,</li>
				<li audio="5">twice as long,</li>
				<li audio="6">one and a half times as long (that is, 50% longer),</li>
				<li audio="7">regular length, as defined by the beats per minute value,</li>
				<li audio="8">half as long, and</li>
				<li audio="9">one quarter as long.</li>

               An easy solution would be to make each note a 
               <tt>String</tt> of two characters.  But, try to make your 
               change compatible with scores defined the old way 
               (that is, scores of single character strings that are 
               standard duration notes).

            Chords are mulitple notes played at the same time.  Leaving
            musical theory aside, a chord is usually three notes, 
            and only certain groups of notes will make a nice sounding
            chord.<br/><br/>
            
               Change the type of score that <tt>ReadSound</tt> can read
               to allow for chords.  You will need to use the methods
               you wrote earlier that add sounds to one another.  
               And, 
               one of the easiest ways to implement this new feature
               is to make a score an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>ArrayList</tt>s,
               where the inner one contains <tt>String</tt>s.  
               This, however, will make these scores incompatible with 
               scores defined the old way.

               Sounds played on non-electronic instruments (e.g., piano
               and guitar) are
               not the same volume throughout their duration.  As you 
               may have noticed,
               the note will start in silence, very quickly increase in volume
               to a maximum, and then slowly get quieter over the 
               duration of the sound.  <br/><br/>
			   
			   Implement this.  Note:
               in order to increase volume quickly enough, especially for
               the lowest notes, you won't
               be able to simply increase the volume <i>between</i>
               cycles.  Rather, the volume will need to increase <i>within</i>
               a cycle, from sample to sample.  Remember your earlier work
               on volume, however: this does not mean <i>adding</i> an
               ever increasing number to each sample.
