Consider a one-second sampled sound that consists of 22,050 integers, each of which
is the maximum possible value (32767). What would this sample sound like when played?

        <div class="text">It would sound like the loudest possible sound.
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">No. It is not the size of individual samples that determine the volume of a sound, but the size of the difference between the biggest and smallest samples.

        <div class="text">It would vary in pitch and volume as it was played.
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">No, change in pitch and volume only come through changes in the individual samples.

        <div class="text">It would be complete silence.

        <div class="feedback">Correct. When there is no <i>change</i> in pressure, there is no sound.

    <div class="choice" identifier="choice 4">
        <div class="text">There is no way to know what it would sound like.
        </div>
        <div class="feedback">Not at all. When you have a sound sampled at sufficient quality (and a sampling rate of 22,050 samples per second is of sufficient quality), you will hear exactly what the sound is. Said another way, an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of numbers like this will determine a sound exactly.
