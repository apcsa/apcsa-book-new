         When we want to change a sound file in some way, we need to 
         write a method in the <tt>Sound</tt>
         class that modifies the 
         numbers in the <tt>ArrayList</tt>
         stored in the <tt>myData</tt>
         instance variable.
      </p>
      <p audio="3" class="quoteBrown">
         The easiest transformations are those that modify 
         each invidual sample in the same way. 
      </p>
      <p audio="4" class="step">
         Write a method <tt>amplify</tt>
         that multiplies 
         every individual sample in a sound by <tt>1.2</tt>.  This 
         will make each sample slightly bigger if it is positive,  
         and slightly smaller if it is negative.  This should make the 
         sound louder.
      </p>
      <ul class="width80">
         <li>
            <p audio="4b">
               You will be operating on the <tt>ArrayList</tt> reference field <tt>myData</tt>, using 
               the <tt>get</tt>
               method to read the original value and the <tt>set</tt>
               method to write a new value to that same
               place.  
               <br/> <br />
               You haven't seen an <tt>ArrayList</tt>'s <tt>set</tt> method
               yet: it takes an index and a value, and sets the cell at that 
               index to the value you give it.

               <br/> <br />
               For example, to increase the 10th element in the list by 1.2. You would write:<br/>
              </p>
               <pre>
               myData.set(9, (int)(myData.get(9) * 1.2));
               </pre>   
             <p audio="4c"> 
              You might be wondering what (int) does?  This is called casting;  it forces the value behind it
               to become an int -- we'll look at this more in the next step.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="4d">

               You'll need to write a loop that runs the same code 
               on each value in the ArrayList. 
         </li>
         <li audio="4e">
     
               When you are done, you will need to call <tt>refresh</tt>
               on the <tt>Sound</tt>
               object to see your changes. 
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p audio="5" class="step">
         Compile the project, load the <tt>birdcall.wav</tt>
         file, and listen to it. 
      </p>
      <p audio="6" class="step">
         Run your <tt>amplify</tt>
         method on it.  Listen again: did it get louder? 
         Run <tt>amplify</tt>
         again and perhaps again, listening each time.
