 Try adding various amounts of noise to the file 
 <tt>Kennedy_berliner.wav</tt>, a famous speech given
 by former U.S. President John Kennedy where he probably
 called himself a jelly doughnut. The original speech had
 quite a bit of noise in it. Describe how much you were able
 to change the original but still be able to understand 
 the words of the speech.</p>

        <div name="Mario">Not much. I could add a small amount of noise and still make out the words. I had to use small integer values and only put it in very sporadically. If I made the number I was adding too big or added too often everything started becoming garbled.

        <div name="Genovieve">Mine was like Mario's but I got a bit more daring. I found a range of values that seemed to effect the over all quality very little no matter how many times -- within reason -- I added it to the sound wave.
