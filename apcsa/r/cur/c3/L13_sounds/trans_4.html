         In sound recording, noise is something to be avoided.  In 
         some recordings you can hear a background "hiss" that was  
         introduced by the microphones or other equipment.  In this 
         exercise, though, let's add some noise to a recording.
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         Noise is, essentially, randomness.  When a samples in a 
         sound jump around randomly rather than following a waveform,
         that means that noise will be heard.  If the random jumping
         is large, the noise will be louder.
      </p>
      <div class="tryit">
         <p audio="4">
            Write a method <tt>addNoise</tt> which takes a single numeric
            argument.  This method will add noise to every 
            invdividual sample in the sound, with the amount of noise
            based on the argument.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="5">
         By including an argument in this method, you can decide how much
         noise you want to add each time you call it.  What is the best
         form the argument should take?  That is, should the argument
         require a <tt>double</tt> or an <tt>int</tt>?  And, 
         what is the range of the number that the argument expects?
         Many different values can work.  The 
         important thing is to think about what the minimum and 
         maximum noise you
         might want to add is.
      </p>
      <p audio="6">
         Try adding noise to one of the sounds of voices, and see how much
         noise you can add and still make out the words.  Be sure to get
         a sense of what noise looks like in the visualizer.
