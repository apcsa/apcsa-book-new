            Adding sound is neat, and wasn't too hard!  So let's 
            write a method to remove all the noise from a sound.  
            That would really help that human president's
            speech.

Unfortunately, once noise has gotten in, it is <b>very</b> hard to remove.  
The main problem is telling what part of an individual sample is due
to the noise and what part is due to the speech, or birdcall, or 
whatever.  
</p>
<p audio="3.m1">Once you can separate the noise from the signal (as its called),
the noise is easy to remove&mdash;just subtract it out.  
But, figuring out that separation exactly, or even pretty closely, is 
usually impossible.
