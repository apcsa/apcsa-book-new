         People have historically be superstitious about the ability to 
         speak backwards. But, this is before they had digital recordings
         of sound and Java programs that manipulate those sounds with
         the greatest of ease.
      </p>
      <div class="tryit">
      <p audio="3">
         Write <tt>reverse</tt>.  Simply put, you need to swap the 
         first and last individual samples, the second and second to last,
         and so forth.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="4">
         Test your code by listening to several different sounds reversed.
         (We have provided many different files inside the <tt>sounds</tt> 
         directory inside your BlueJ project.  Try using the <tt>Sound</tt> 
         constructor that takes no argument: it will open a dialog box for 
         you choose from.
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         Another test: a sound that is reversed twice should be <i>exactly</i> 
         the same as the original sound.
