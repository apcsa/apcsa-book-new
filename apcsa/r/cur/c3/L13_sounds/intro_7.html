         Open the <tt>Sound</tt>
         class now, and look at it.  There are several methods
         that you will use in this lesson.  Read the comments to understand
         how you will use them.  Some of the methods duplicate the behaviors 
         you can get from the viewer buttons (e.g., <tt>play</tt>).

         One important method is <tt>refresh</tt>.  In this lesson, you
         are going to write 
         your own methods that make changes to the integers in the sound's
         <tt>ArrayList</tt>.  However, the viewer won't know you've changed them
         unless you invoke the <tt>refresh</tt> method.  Only then will
         the picture update and reflect the new sample values.
