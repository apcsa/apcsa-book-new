         At the top of the viewer is a miniature image of the entire 
         <span class="vocab">sound waveform</span>. 
         The numbers at the bottom are seconds, and show that this birdsong 
         is about 2 and a half seconds long.  The <tt>ArrayList</tt>
         for this 
         sound holds about 55,000 integers, therefore. 
      </p>

         Let's zoom in to take a look.  Click your mouse button down about 
         half way along the large image, and drag it to the right about  
         a quarter of the way to the right edge of the window. 
      </p>

         After selecting the "Zoom In" button in the view, the viewer 
         window will give you a closer look at the portion that you 
         selected.  Look at the miniature waveform at the top: the 
         green band shows you the zoomed in portion of the current
         sound.
