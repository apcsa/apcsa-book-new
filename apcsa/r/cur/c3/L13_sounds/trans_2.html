      <title>Normalizing a sound, to make it as loud as can be</title>
   </head>

      <p audio="2">
         Obviously just spreading all the samples in a sound out can 
         be problematic.  What professionals will often do is <span class="vocab">normalize</span>
         a sound, which means making it 
         as loud as possible without changing its character. 
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         In order to normalize, you need to:
         <ul>
               <li>figure out what the largest individual sample is by taking the absolute value of every sample -- you are trying to find the sample whose value is farthest from zero whether that be a maximum or minimum.</li>
               <li>find the factor by which you multiply the maximum from the last step to reach 32,767</li>
               <li>multiply every number in the sample by your factor from the previous step</li>
         </ul>  

      </p>
      <div class="tryit">
         <p audio="4">
            Write the method <tt>normalize</tt>, which takes no arguments
            and normalizes the sound.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="4">
         Two hints:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="4b">
         
               You will need two loops, one after the other. 
         </li>
         <li audio="4c">
            
               You can find the factor you need by using
               ratios:  your factor is equal to the maximum possible integer value(32,767) 
               divided by the maximum number in your sample.
         </li>
      </ol>
