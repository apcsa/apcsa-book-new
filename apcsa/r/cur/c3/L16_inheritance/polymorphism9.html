We, however, are smarter than the Java compiler.
We know that we have only inserted <tt>Points</tt> and <tt>TracedPoints</tt> 
into the <tt>ArrayList</tt>, and we know that they have <tt>move</tt> methods.
We communicate this information to the compiler by a type <i>cast</i>, 
putting a class name in parentheses immediately preceding a reference or reference expression.
Here's how we would successfully call the <tt>move</tt> methods of the <tt>ArrayList</tt> elements.
</p>
<pre class="width40">
for (int k=0; k&lt;a.size( ); k++) {
    ((Point) a.get(k)).move (7, 9);
}
</pre>
<p audio="3">
The compiler knows that <tt>a.get</tt> returns a reference to an <tt>Object</tt>.
The cast causes the reference to be interpreted as a <tt>Point</tt>, 
which allows the compiler to find a <tt>move</tt> method.</p>
