Once the compiler is satisfied that a <tt>move</tt> method is available for an object, 
the runtime system then selects the <em>most specialized</em> <tt>move</tt> method to call.
For a <tt>Point</tt>, it uses the <tt>Point move</tt> method.  
For a <tt>TracedPoint</tt>, it uses the <tt>TracedPoint move</tt> method.

We just considered the code
</p>
<pre class="width60">
    ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; ( );
    a.add (new Point (10, 11));
    a.add ("abcd"); // a String object
    a.add (new Player ( ));
    for (int k=0; k&lt;a.size( ); k++) {
        System.out.println (a.get (k));
    }
</pre>

Why did it work?
Because the compiler noted that a <tt>toString</tt> method is defined 
in the <tt>Object</tt> class, and was satisfied.

A mantra to help understand this:
<em>an object always remembers how it was constructed,
and chooses a method from the class of which it is an instance.</em>
