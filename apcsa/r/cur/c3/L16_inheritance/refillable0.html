Recall the <tt>Refillable</tt> class from the beginning of the course.
We designed it by looking at common features of more specific classes representing
candy jars, Coca Cola coolers, and score keepers.
We then went on to enhance the <tt>Refillable</tt> class, adding a feature to keep track
of the average amount used per call to the <tt>useUp</tt> method.

But now put yourself in a somewhat different situation:
someone has provided you with the <tt>Refillable</tt> class,
and you want to use it to implement a soft drink cooler.
This is where inheritance comes in handy.
