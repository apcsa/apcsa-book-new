      <title>Building a Specialized Counter</title>

Consider a <tt>Counter</tt> class that provides several public methods.
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">a constructor that initializes the counter to 0;</li>
	<li audio="4">a <tt>void increment</tt> method that adds 1 to the counter's value;</li>
	<li audio="5">a <tt>void reset</tt> method that resets the counter to 0; and</li>
	<li audio="6">an <tt>int value</tt> method that returns the counter's value.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="7">
Now suppose we want to define a "mod N" counter, whose value cycles from 0 to N-1 and back.  
There are lots of real-life examples of mod N counters including clocks, 
automobile odometers, and television channel selectors.
Provide a definition of a <tt>ModNCounter</tt> class that extends the <tt>Counter</tt> class.
Take advantage of the <tt>Counter</tt> methods as much as possible 
rather than reinventing the wheel;
in particular, your <tt>ModNCounter</tt> class should only have <i>one</i> instance variable.
