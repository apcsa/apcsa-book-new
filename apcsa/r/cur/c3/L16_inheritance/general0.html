<p audio="3">
Inheritance relationships throughout Java form a <span class="vocab">hierarchy</span>,
with the most general class&mdash;named <tt>Object</tt>&mdash;at the top.
Every class definition that doesn't explicitly extend some other class
implicitly extends the <tt>Object</tt> class.
<br/>
<br/>
For example,
</p>
<pre>
public class Refillable { ... }
</pre>

<p audio="4">
Since Refillable does not extend anything explicitly it automatically extends <tt>Object</tt>.
<br/><br/>

Likewise, the <tt>java.util</tt> class library provides a hierarchy of classes
called the <tt>Collection</tt> hierarchy that is rooted at the <tt>Object</tt> class
and includes the <tt>ArrayList</tt> class.
