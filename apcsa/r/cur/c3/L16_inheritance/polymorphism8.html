To determine the legality of the method call
</p>
<pre class="width40">
    p.move (7, 9);
</pre>
<p audio="3">
the compiler examines the type of <tt>p</tt>.
If the class for which <tt>p</tt> is a reference, or one of its superclasses, 
contains a <tt>move</tt> method that takes two integers as arguments, the statement is legal.
If not, an error message results.  Similarly, for a statement like
</p>
<pre class="width40">
    a.get(3).move(7,9);
</pre>
<p audio="4">
the compiler examines the type of <tt>a.get(3)</tt>, 
searching for a <tt>move</tt> method either in the corresponding class 
or one of its superclasses.
According to the online documentation for <tt>ArrayList</tt>,
the <tt>get</tt> method returns an <tt>Object</tt>.
<tt>Objects</tt> don't have a <tt>move</tt> method; thus, the error message.
</p>
<p audio="5">
We just considered the alternative of
</p>
<pre class="width40">
    Point p = a.get(3);
    p.move(7,9);
</pre>
<p audio="6">
The statement <tt>p.move(7,9);</tt> would work fine; <tt>p</tt> is a reference 
of type <tt>Point</tt>, and the <tt>Point</tt> class has a <tt>move</tt> method.
The compiler's complaint arises from the assignment statement; 
it objects to the attempt to take a reference to an <tt>Object</tt> 
and store it in a <tt>Point</tt> reference.  
Since almost all <tt>Objects</tt> are <i>not</i> <tt>Points</tt>, 
the compiler has probability on its side.
