As you may have noticed,
it's possible to pass a subclass instance where a superclass instance is expected.
In order to compare, say, the <tt>Unforgiving</tt> player with the <tt>TitForTat</tt> player 
in the Prisoner's Dilemma simulation,
we created an instance of <tt>Unforgiving</tt> and an instance of <tt>TitForTat</tt>
and passed them as arguments to the <tt>Simulation</tt> constructor,
which is expecting to receive two <tt>Player</tt> objects.
Not only will this be accepted by the compiler,
but the compiled code will use the <tt>cooperates</tt> methods 
of <tt>Unforgiving</tt> and <tt>TitForTat</tt>.

This facility is called <span class="vocab">polymorphism</span>.
The word "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words for "many" and "forms". 
In the context of object-oriented programming, it means that a given object 
can be regarded either as an instance of its own class, 
as an instance of its superclass, 
as an instance of its superclass's superclass, and so on up the hierarchy.</p>
