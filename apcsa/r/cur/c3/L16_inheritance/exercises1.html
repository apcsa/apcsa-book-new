Some classes provide "setter" methods.
A useful debugging aid is to override a setter method to produce informative output 
at each time that the object's state changes.
</p>
<p audio="3">
We've already worked with the <tt>Point</tt> class in the <tt>java.awt</tt> library.
Its setter method is named <tt>move</tt>;
the call
</p>
<pre class="width40">
   p.move (27, 13);
</pre>
<p audio="4">
changes the <tt>x</tt> coordinate to 27 and the <tt>y</tt> coordinate to 13 
in the <tt>Point</tt> referenced by <tt>p</tt>.
It also provides <tt>getX</tt> and <tt>getY</tt> access methods.
</p>
<p audio="5">
Given below is the framework for a <tt>TracedPoint</tt> class 
intended to intercept calls to <tt>move</tt> and print information 
about the pre- and post-change state of the <tt>Point</tt> along with doing the move.
If the <tt>TracedPoint</tt> object named <tt>p</tt> currently represents the point (3,5),
then the call
</p>
<pre class="width40">
   p.move (9,8)
</pre>
<p audio="6">
should print a message like
</p>
<pre class="width50">
   Point change: was (3,5), is now (9,8)
</pre>
<p audio="7">
as well as changing the point's value.</p>

<p><b audio="8">Now you should complete and test the following framework:</b></p>

<pre class="width50">
import java.awt.*;

public class TracedPoint extends Point {

    public TracedPoint (int x, int y) {
        super (x, y);
    }

    // Your move method goes here.
}
</pre>
<p audio="9">
Take advantage of the superclass's methods and variables as much as possible 
rather than reinventing the wheel.
In particular, your solution shouldn't have any instance variables.
