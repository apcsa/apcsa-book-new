It doesn't make much sense to set up a <tt>CokeCooler</tt> class that provides <i>exactly</i>
the functionality of <tt>Refillable</tt>&mdash;in that case, 
we should just use <tt>Refillable</tt> as is.
But suppose we want to provide some <tt>CokeCooler</tt>-specific output,
by printing the amount of drinks in the cooler during each <tt>refill</tt> or <tt>useUp</tt> call.
We do this by providing our own <tt>refill</tt> 
and <tt>useUp</tt> methods&mdash;<span class="vocab">overriding</span>
those of <tt>Refillable</tt>.
We can call the corresponding superclasses overridden method using the <tt>super</tt> keyword;  for example, <tt>super.refill(amount)</tt> and <tt>super.useUp(amount)</tt>
access the overridden methods passing <tt>amount</tt> as the argument. Here is the code.
</p>
<pre class="width80">
public class CokeCooler extends Refillable {

   public CokeCooler (int initialAmount) {
      super (initialAmount);
   }

   public void useUp (int amount) {
      super.useUp (amount);
      System.out.println ("There are now " +
	    currentAmount ( ) + " Cokes in the cooler.");
   }

   public void refill (int amount) {
      super.refill (amount);
      System.out.println ("There are now " +
	    currentAmount ( ) + " Cokes in the cooler.");
   }
}   
</pre>
<p audio="3">
<tt>CokeCooler</tt> inherits <tt>Refillable</tt>'s currentAmount method, 
so it can use it without needing an explicit object reference of type <tt>Refillable</tt>.
Each of the methods listed above first calls its <tt>Refillable</tt> counterpart,
then (in <tt>useUp</tt> and <tt>refill</tt>) prints out the CokeCooler specific function of printing the current amount to the console.
</p>

In fact, the first thing every subclass constructor must do is call the superclass constructor;
if the <tt>super</tt> call is omitted, Java substitutes a call to the 0-argument
superclass constructor to try to ensure that all the object's instance variables
are properly initialized.
