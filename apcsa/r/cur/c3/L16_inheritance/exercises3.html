Add a class named <tt>Competitor</tt> that extends <tt>Player</tt>.
A <tt>Competitor</tt> always competes, never cooperates.
Take advantage of methods provided in the <tt>Player</tt> class as much as possible.</p>

<div class="tryIt">
<p audio="2">
Using the <tt>Competitor</tt> class you just coded, supply a new <tt>Competitor</tt> object as one of the <tt>Simulation</tt> arguments,
and verify that always competing with someone who is always cooperating
is an excellent strategy.
