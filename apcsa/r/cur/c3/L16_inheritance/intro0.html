         In upcoming activities, you'll work with <span class="vocab" term="inheritance">inheritance</span>,
         the mechanism by which one can define a class as "almost like" another.
         Inheritance lets us more easily use library classes such as those providing
         graphical interaction.
         It also simplifies <span class="vocab" term="reuse">reuse</span>: taking advantage
         of already existing code, avoiding "reinventing the wheel".
