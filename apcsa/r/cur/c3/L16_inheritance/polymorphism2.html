An especially convenient application of polymorphism is the <tt>toString</tt> method.
<tt>toString</tt> is called by <tt>System.out.print</tt> and <tt>System.out.println</tt>,
and thus is useful for debugging and testing a class.
It's a method of the <tt>Object</tt> class, so every class has a <tt>toString</tt> method available
for <tt>System.out.print</tt> and <tt>System.out.println</tt> to use.

Unfortunately, the <tt>toString</tt> method provided by the <tt>Object</tt> class isn't very useful.
It returns a <tt>String</tt> that says where the object resides in memory.
That makes it a great candidate for overriding.
