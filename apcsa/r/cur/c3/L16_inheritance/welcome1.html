            There are five more general areas in the course.

      <p class="step" audio="2">
         <b>Inheritance</b>.  Coming next is inheritance, 
         which we've mentioned before, in the <i>Graphics</i>
         and <i>Listeners</i>
         lessons. 
         This is a way of writing classes that  
         borrow from already written classes. 
      </p>
      <!--
      <p class="step" audio="3">
         <b>Grid World</b>.  This is an extended example included in all 
         AP Computer Science courses. You'll get to 
         program things (like insects and flowers) that live and interact
         on a world shaped like a giant grid.  It covers a variety of
         topics, but mostly focuses on inheritance.
      </p>
      -->
      <p class="step" audio="4">
         <b>Arrays</b>.  You know about <tt>ArrayLists</tt>; arrays 
         are a more commonly used but actually <i>less</i>
         powerful 
         way of grouping things in Java.  After a quick intro we'll 
         move into working on grouping in two dimensions.  2D let's you program board games like chess, create classes that use maps 
         and diagrams, and more.  We'll also look into image and picture 
         manipulation.
      </p>
      <p class="step" audio="5">
         <b>Recursion</b>.  Recursion is a simple idea&mdash;writing methods
         that use <i>themselves</i> as helpers&mdash;that you can use to write 
         programs to solve complicated problems.  We'll use recursion to draw 
         strange shapes, solve mazes, and more.
      </p>
            <p class="step" audio="6">
         <b>The AP test</b>.  You'll have covered all you need to take
         the AP test by this point, but we'll spend some time reviewing
         and practicing.
      </p>
            <p class="step" audio="7">
         <b>A Big Project</b>.  There will generally be
         several weeks left in the course after the AP test.  A perfect time
         to craft a big project! We'll offer up some ideas. </p>
