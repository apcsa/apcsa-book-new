The Java compiler and runtime system have to resolve two questions 
that arise when polymorphism is used.
<ol>
<li>The compiler, which wants to catch inconsistencies and other possibilities for error, 
asks <i>whether</i> a method with a given name can be invoked on a given object.</li>
<li>Once the compiler has answered "yes" to that question, 
the runtime system needs to find which of the possible versions of that method 
is the right one to invoke.</li>
</ol>
