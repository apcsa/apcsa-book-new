The Prisoner's Dilemma problem describes a two-player game played as follows:
At each turn in the game, each player says whether or not he will cooperate with
or compete with his opponent.
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">If both players cooperate, they each receive 3 points.</li>
	
	<li audio="4">If both players compete, they each receive 1 point.</li>
	<li audio="5">If one player cooperates and the other competes, 
	    the successful competitor will receive 5 points 
	    and the unsuccessful cooperator none.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<br />
<p audio="6">
This process is repeated a specified number of turns.
The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible.
</p>
<p audio="7">
One can show that, in a single turn, it's in each player's interest to compete
rather than cooperate. Over the course of the entire game, however,
players can observe and react to each other's choices;
thus the incentive to compete can be overcome by the greater potential payoff for cooperation.
</p>

	In the next four steps we're going to ask you to code different types of player strategies and have the players fight against each other.

The program [<tt>/lesson16/PrisonerDilemmaIntro</tt>] includes a <tt>Player</tt> class that represents a player who always cooperates,
and a <tt>Simulation</tt> class for playing two players against one another.
Run the program and verify that each player is earning 3 points at each turn.
