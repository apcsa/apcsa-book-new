We now move on to work with polymorphic collections,
specifically <tt>ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;</tt>.
Recall that <tt>ArrayList</tt> methods include the following.
</p>
<pre class="width80">
    // Add an object to the end of the ArrayList.
    // The return value is always true (and is therefore
    // usually ignored) since there aren't any circumstances
    // that the add could fail.
    boolean add (Object o);

    // Return the object at the given position in the ArrayList.
    Object get (int index);

    // Return the number of elements that have been added
    // to the ArrayList; similar to the myCount information in
    // the IntSequence class.
    int size ( );

    // Return true if the ArrayList contains the given object,
    // and return false if not.
    boolean contains (Object o);
</pre>
<p audio="3">
Since every class inherits from <tt>Object</tt> (at least indirectly)
these operations provide a data structure that can store objects of any type.
</p>
<p audio="4">
Here's an example:</p>
<pre class="width70">
    ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; ( );
    a.add (new Point (10, 11));
    a.add ("abcd"); // a String object
    a.add (new Player ( ));
    for (int k=0; k&lt;a.size( ); k++) {
        System.out.println (a.get (k));
    }
</pre>
<p audio="5">
The output is
</p>
<pre class="width60">
   java.awt.Point[x=10,y=11]
   abcd
   Player that always cooperates
</pre>
<p audio="6">
showing that each object's own <tt>toString</tt> method was used 
to construct the corresponding output line.
