In the Monty Hall simulation, we compared the strategy of always switching doors
with the strategy of never switching.</p>

<p audio="3">A version of that program using inheritance could use a <tt>Player</tt> class
with a <tt>chooseDoor</tt> method,
along with subclasses <tt>SwitchingPlayer</tt> and <tt>StayingPlayer</tt> that override
the <tt>chooseDoor</tt> method to implement the switching and staying strategies.

Some board games have pieces that share some attributes but move differently.
For example, an uncrowned checker piece moves differently from a king.
The features common to all pieces could be included in a superclass that would be
inherited by a class representing uncrowned pieces and another class representing kings.
