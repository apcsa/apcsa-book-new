        <title>Shortcuts to incrementing and decrementing</title>

<p audio="1">
Suppose <tt>k</tt> is an integer variable.
Then the statement
</p>
<pre class="width20">
    k++;
</pre>
<p audio="2">
has the same effect as the statement
</p>
<pre class="width20">
    k = k + 1;
</pre>
<p audio="3">
There is a similar shortcut for decrementing:
</p>
<pre class="width20">
    k--;
</pre>
<p audio="4">
has the same effect as
</p>
<pre class="width20">
    k = k - 1;
</pre>
<p audio="5">
The motivation for this shorthand notation is that 
the operations of incrementing and decrementing by 1 are <i>very</i> common.
</p>
<p audio="6">
It is legal in Java to increment or decrement a variable within a larger expression, for example, <tt>System.out.println(values.get(k++))</tt>.
Don't do this; it's asking for off-by-one errors.
We will actively discourage you from using the <tt>++</tt> or <tt>--</tt> operators 
anywhere but on a line (or a <tt>for</tt> loop increment) by themselves.</p>
