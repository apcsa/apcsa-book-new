This program intends to collect positions of mouse clicks and
draw lines that connect each consecutive pair of clicks in order to form a polygon.
More specifically, you should add code to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>declare an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>Point</tt> objects;</p></li>
<li><p>supply a body of the <tt>mouseClicked</tt> method
in which the position of the click is stored in a <tt>Point</tt> object
and added to the <tt>ArrayList</tt>, and ended with a call to <tt>repaint</tt>;</p></li>
<li><p>complete the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method with code that
draws a filled circle at each click position and connects consecutive clicks with a line as shown below.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
A good way to draw the mouse clicks is
</p>
<pre>
Point p = ...;
g.fillOval (p.x-5, p.y-5, 10, 10);
</pre>
