In programs we've written so far, every piece of information had to be stored
in a separate variable.  In the <tt>Name</tt> class, we needed three instance
variables to store the three components of a name.  To keep track of three dice,
we needed three <tt>DieRollGenerator</tt> variables. And so on.

Upcoming activities will introduce a <span class="vocab">collection class</span>
called an <tt>ArrayList</tt>. 
Such a class is appropriate whenever we have a group of elements, all the same type,
that we want to store <i>collectively</i>.
Some real-world examples are the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">a book (elements are the individual pages);</li>
	<li audio="4">a parking lot (elements are the individual parking spaces);</li>
	<li audio="5">a library (elements are the individual books).</li>
</ul>
