<title>Maintaining a "top ten" list</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Some video games keep track of the highest scores that players have achieved. This exercise involves implementing such a feature. 
</p>
<p>
We start with a simple class that represents a person and the score he or she has received.
</p>
<pre>
public class Score {
   
   private int myPoints;
   private Name myPlayerName;

   public Score (int points, Name playerName) {
      myPoints = points;
      myPlayerName = playerName;
   }

   // Return true if this Score's myPoints is greater than
   // the argument Score's myPoints; return false otherwise.
   public boolean isBetterThan (Score score) {
      ...
   }

   public String toString ( ) {
      return myPoints + "\t" + myPlayerName;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
Now define and test a <tt>TopTen</tt> class whose single instance variable
is an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>Score</tt> objects.
This class provides the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A constructor with no arguments.</li>
<li>A <tt>void</tt> method named <tt>update</tt> that takes a <tt>Score</tt> and adds it to the score collection.</li>
<li>A <tt>void</tt> method named <tt>print</tt> that prints the top ten <tt>Score</tt> objects, ordered from highest to lowest points. If there are fewer than ten scores in the collection, <tt>print</tt> should print as many as are currently in the collection.</li>
</ul> 
</body>
