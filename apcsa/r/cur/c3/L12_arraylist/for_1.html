Here are several equivalent uses of loops to compute <tt>n</tt> factorial 
(the product of all the positive integers up through <tt>n</tt>).
</p>
<table id="tableBlue">
<tr><td><pre>
for (int k=n, product=1; k&gt;0; k=k-1) {
    product = product * k;
}
</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
product = 1;
for (int k=n; k&gt;0; k=k-1) { // product initialized outside loop
    product = product * k;
}
</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
product = 1;
for (int k=n; k&gt;0; ) { // test performed inside loop
    product = product * k;
    k=k-1;
}
</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
product = 1;
int k;
while (k&gt;0) { // the while equivalent
    product = product * k;
    k=k-1;
}
</pre></td></tr>
</table>

The <tt>for</tt> loop is basically a repackaged <tt>while</tt> loop 
that puts all the information about how long the loop should continue in one place.
Thus a <tt>for</tt> loop is generally easier to understand than an equivalent <tt>while</tt> loop.
