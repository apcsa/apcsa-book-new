<title>Loops and processing patterns</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
We also worked with another looping construct, the <tt>for</tt> statement.
There are two kinds of <tt>for</tt> statement:
</p>
<pre>
for ( <i>initialization</i>,
      <i>continuation test</i>,
      <i>update</i> ) {
   <i>statements to repeat</i>
}

for ( <i>iteration variable</i> : <i>ArrayList</i> ) {
   <i>statements to repeat</i>
}
</pre>
<p>
The statements to repeat comprise the <i>loop body</i>.
In the first form of <tt>for</tt> loop,
we specify initializations necessary to start the loop,
a boolean expression that says whether to execute the body
one more time, 
and statements that update loop variables.  (These often involve
incrementing using the <tt>++</tt> operator or decrementing using the <tt>--</tt> operator.)
The second form assumes that a collection is involved,
and executes the body for each element of the collection.
</p>
<p>
We also encountered several <i>patterns</i> for collection processing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>processing every element of the collection;</li>
<li>searching for a collection element that satisfies a given condition; and</li>
<li>processing every pair of <i>consecutive</i> sequence elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Instances of these patterns will appear over and over in subsequent lessons.
