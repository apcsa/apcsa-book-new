<p audio="1">
The <tt>ArrayList</tt> in which clicks are collected is named <tt>myCorners</tt>.
It's declared with the <tt>myWindowWidth</tt> and <tt>myWindowHeight</tt> variables,
and initialized in the <tt>Polygon</tt> constructor to be an empty <tt>ArrayList</tt>.
</p>
<p audio="2">
Each successive pair of mouse click coordinates is stored in a <tt>Point</tt> object 
(<tt>Point</tt> is declared in <tt>java.awt</tt>;
it has <i>public</i> instance variables named <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.)
After saving the most recent click, the program draws the partially completed polygon.
If the polygon is complete&mdash;the current click is sufficiently near any
of the earlier clicks&mdash;the
program empties <tt>myCorners</tt> and continues.
