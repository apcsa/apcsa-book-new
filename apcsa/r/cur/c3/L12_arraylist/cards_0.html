A computer implementation of the card game of Poker includes numerous examples
of array processing.
A Poker program would include a <tt>Card</tt> class whose methods include the following:
<ul>
	<li audio="2"><tt>int rank ( )</tt>, which returns an int between 2 and 14, inclusive 
	    (11 represents a jack, 12 a queen, 13 a king, and 14 an ace);</li>
	<li audio="3"><tt>int suit ( )</tt>, which returns an integer from 1 to 4 
	    (representing the four suits&mdash;clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades);</li>
	<li audio="4">a zero-argument constructor, which initializes a <tt>Card</tt> with randomly chosen
	    rank and suit.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="5">
A poker hand or a deck of cards would then be an <tt>ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;</tt> object.
