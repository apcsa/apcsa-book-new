        <title>Extending DotRacing with ArrayLists</title>
</head>
<body>

<p audio="1">
Remember the <tt>DotRacing</tt> program?  Use <tt>ArrayList</tt>s to allow any number of 
racers.
</p>
<div class="openbluejproj" project="lesson12/DotRacingArrayList">
         <p audio="7">Open the <tt>DotRacingArrayList</tt> project
            (<b>lesson12/DotRacingArrayList</b>).</p>
</div>
<p audio="3">
The <tt>Dot</tt> class hasn't been changed from the project you used way back in 
lesson 10, but the <tt>DotRacingArrayList</tt> class is different in several ways from
the <Tt>DotRacing</Tt> class you used then.  The main difference is the <tt>dots</tt>
instance variable, which is an <tt>ArrayList</tt> that holds <tt>Dot</tt> objects.</p>

<p audio="3c">You'll need to finish three methods to make this program work correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li audio="4c">
The <tt>initializeRacers</tt> method needs set up <tt>dots</tt> correctly.  The main loop
has already be done for you.
</li>
<li audio="5">
The <tt>whoMoves</tt> method needs to return a randomly choosen <tt>Dot</tt> object.
</li>
<li audio="6">
And, the <tt>drawRacers</tt> method needs to call <tt>drawRacer</tt> for each <tt>Dot</tt>
object in <tt>dots</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="7">After you have finished the program, test it by changing the number of racers
in a race&mdash;this is specified in the <tt>initializeRacers</tt> method.</p>
<p audio="9" class="quoteOrange">
You might be interested in the <tt>randomName</tt> and <tt>randomColor</tt> methods, which
set up <tt>ArrayList</tt>s and randomly pick an element from each.  Can you modify them 
so that duplicate names and/or colors aren't choosen in a race?  This might be tricky!</p>
