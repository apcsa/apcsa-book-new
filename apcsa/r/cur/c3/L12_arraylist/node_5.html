<title>ArrayList methods (2)</title>
</head>
<p>
The <tt>add</tt> method puts its argument at the end of the <tt>ArrayList</tt> and increases the size by 1.
Here's an example, using the <tt>ArrayList</tt> of names just introduced:
</p>
<pre>
   <tt>friends.add (new Name ("SpongeBob", "SquarePants"));</tt>
</pre>
<p>
<tt>friends.get(0)</tt> would return the name we just added; <tt>get</tt> with any other integer argument would cause an "array index out of bounds" exception.
</p>
<p>
The argument to <tt>add</tt> should be an initialized <i>object</i>.
In the example just given, that object is created on the fly, since <tt>new</tt> produces an initialized object. The example could also have been written as follows:
</p>
<pre>
   Name myPal = new Name ("SpongeBob", "SquarePants");
   friends.add (myPal);
</pre>
<body>
</body>
