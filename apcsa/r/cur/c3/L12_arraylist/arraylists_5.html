Code you wrote for the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method most likely contains an example of a common <tt>ArrayList</tt> pattern,
that of <i>processing every element</i> in the <tt>ArrayList</tt>.
A variable is initialized to 0, then incremented each time through the loop
in order to process element 0, element 1, and so on up to element <tt>size()-1</tt>.
In pseudocode, it looks like the following:
</p>
<pre class="width60">
k = 0;
while (k &lt; <i>the size of the ArrayList</i>) {
   <i>process element k of the ArrayList;</i>
   k = k + 1;
}
</pre>

Code you wrote for the <tt>mouseClicked</tt> method probably involved <i>search</i> in an <tt>ArrayList</tt>,
another common pattern.
The code resembles that of processing every element&mdash;where "processing"
means "checking whether the element is what we're searching for"&mdash;
except that it is possible for the loop to end early if the search succeeds.
Exiting the loop is done with the <tt>break</tt> statement.
Here is pseudocode.
</p>
<pre class="width60">
k = 0;
while (k &lt; <i>the size of the ArrayList</i>) {
   <i>if element k of the ArrayList is what we're searching for</i>) {
      break;
   }
   k = k + 1;
}
</pre>
