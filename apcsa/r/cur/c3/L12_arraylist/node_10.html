<p>
Some of the classes we studied earlier made use of several instance variables
to represent a <i>collection</i> of information.
Examples include
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
<tt>myFirst</tt>, <tt>myMiddle</tt>, and <tt>myLast</tt> in the <tt>Name</tt> class;
</li>
<li>
<tt>racer0</tt>, <tt>racer1</tt>, and <tt>racer2</tt> in the <tt>DotRacing</tt> class; and
</li>
<li>
<tt>door1isClosed</tt>, <tt>door2isClosed</tt>, and <tt>door3isClosed</tt>
in the <tt>Stage</tt> class in the Monty Hall program.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Code to process these collections is somewhat clumsy.
For instance, consider the <tt>DotRacing whoMoves</tt> method:
</p>
<pre>
public Dot whoMoves ( ) {
   int moverChoice = randGen.nextInt (2);
   if (moverChoice == 0) {
      return racer0;
   } else if (moverChoice == 1) {
      return racer1;
   } else if (moverChoice == 2) {	
      return racer2;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
With more doors, the code would be even more awkward.
Ideally, there would be a way to use a single statement, something like
</p>
<blockquote>
Use <tt>moverChoice</tt> to access the <tt>racer___</tt> variable,
and return its contents.
</blockquote>
