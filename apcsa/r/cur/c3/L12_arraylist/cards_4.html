<p audio="1">
It is also useful in Poker to determine the most often-occurring rank in the hand:
</p>
<ol>
	<li audio="2">Does the hand contain four cards, all of the same rank? If so, return 4.</li>
	<li audio="3">If not, does the hand contain three cards, all of the same rank? If so, return 3.</li>
	<li audio="4">If not, does the hand contain two cards of the same rank? If so, return 2.</li>
	<li audio="5">Otherwise return 1.</li>
</ol>
<p audio="6">
One approach to computing this value is to check how many times <i>each rank</i>
occurs in the hand.  Open the BlueJ project for this node and take a look at the pseudocode in the <tt>maxInRank</tt> in the <tt>Hand</tt> class.
</p>
<div class="openbluejproj" project="lesson12\Card3">
         <p audio="7">Open the current project in BlueJ 
            (<b>lesson12\Card3</b>).</p>
        </div>
<p audio="8">
Complete the <tt>maxInRank</tt> method.
Your solution should involve a loop&mdash;counting occurrences of <tt>r</tt>&mdash;within 
the outer loop.  This situation is called a <span class="vocab">nested loop</span>.
<br/>
<br/>
A test method, <tt>testMaxInRank</tt>, is provided. After you implement the <tt>maxInRank</tt>, execute <tt>testMaxInRank</tt>. The output should be the following:<br/><br/>
This test should show 1 card rank the same :1<br/>
This test should show 2 card rank the same :2<br/>
This test should show 3 card rank the same :3<br/>
This test should show 4 card rank the same :4
