An <tt>ArrayList</tt> object is an <i>ordered</i> collection.
That means there is a first element, a second element, and so on.
Every element has a <i>position</i>, also referred to as its <span class="vocab">index</span>,
as well as its <i>contents</i>, a value.
Positions start at 0 as they do in <tt>String</tt> objects.
