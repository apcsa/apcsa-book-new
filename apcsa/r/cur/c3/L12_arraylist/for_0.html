The <tt>for</tt> statement provides another way in Java to repeat a given program segment.  
It starts with the word "for", continues with loop information inside parentheses, 
and ends with the segment to be repeated&mdash;the <i>loop body</i>&mdash;enclosed in curly braces.
</p>
<pre class="width60" >
for (<i>initializations</i> ; <i>test</i>; <i>increments</i>){
   ...
}
</pre>
<p audio="3">
Loop execution proceeds as follows.
</p>
<ol>
	<li audio="4">First, the initializations are performed.</li>
	<li audio="5">Then the test is evaluated. 
	    If it's false, the loop is finished and execution continues with the following statement.
	    If the test is true, the loop body is executed.</li>
	<li audio="6">Then the increments are performed.</li>
	<li audio="7">The test is evaluated again; a failed test halts the loop, 
	    while a successful test results in another execution of the loop body.</li>
</ol>

The following would print the first name of every <tt>Name</tt> object in the friends list, assuming 
the <tt>Name</tt> object has a method <tt>firstName()</tt> defined to return the first name.
</p>
<pre class="width60">
// Print the initials of the names in friends.
for (int x = 0; x < friends.size(); x++) {
   System.out.println (friends.get(x).firstName());
}
</pre>
