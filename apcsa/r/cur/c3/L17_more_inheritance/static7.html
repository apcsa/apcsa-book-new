The term "static" is also used with methods.
Methods we've seen so far have an implicit parameter,
the instance of the class that contains the method,
that we refer to as <tt>this</tt>.
A static method does not have this implicit parameter,
either because the method doesn't need it,
or because no objects have yet been instantiated.
</p>
<p>
An example of a method that doesn't need <tt>this</tt> is the following,
which returns the smaller of its two argument values.
</p>
<pre>
public static int min (int a, int b) {
   if (a &lt; b) {
      return a;
   } else {
      return b;
   }
}
</pre>
<p>
This method is self-contained; all the information it needs is passed as arguments. 
It doesn't use any instance variables or any non-static methods.
</p>
<p>
As it happens, <tt>min</tt> is provided in the Java <tt>Math</tt> class along with a variety
of other useful static methods.
Accessing static methods is similar to accessing static variables.
For example, we might say
</p>
<pre>
int smaller = Math.min (a, b);
</pre>
