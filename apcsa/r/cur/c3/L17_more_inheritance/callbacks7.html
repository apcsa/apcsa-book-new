As just noted, the <tt>Object</tt> class contains definitions 
for <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>toString</tt>.
Unfortunately, they are not too useful.
<tt>Object.equals</tt> compares the object's <i>reference</i>&mdash;basically, 
its location in memory&mdash;to the argument reference, 
performing the same comparison as does <tt>==</tt>.
<tt>Object.toString</tt> returns a printable representation of this reference.

<p class="quoteOrange" audio="2">
Thus it is a Java convention, when defining a class, to provide definitions 
for <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>toString</tt>.
The <tt>equals</tt> method should compare two objects for <i>content</i>. 
It typically starts by casting the argument in order to access relevant instance variables, 
then does the comparison.
We just saw a version of <tt>equals</tt> that uses <tt>toString</tt>; 
this is fine as long as every object in the class has a unique printable representation.
