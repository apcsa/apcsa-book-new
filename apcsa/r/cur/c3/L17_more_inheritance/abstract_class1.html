In Java, such a placeholder method is called an <span class="vocab">abstract method</span>.
It is specified with only a header:
</p>
<pre class="width70">
   public abstract boolean cooperates ( );
</pre>
<p audio="2">
A class that contains an abstract method must be declared as 
an <span class="vocab">abstract class</span>, using the <tt>abstract</tt> keyword.
</p>
<pre>
<span class="codeHighlight1">public abstract class Player {</span>

   private int myScore;

   public Player ( ) {
      myScore = 0;
   }

   public void increaseScore (int amt) {
      myScore += amt;
   }

   public int score ( ) {
      return myScore;
   }

<span class="codeHighlight1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public abstract boolean cooperates ( );</span>

   public void remember (boolean opponentChoice) {
   }
}
</pre>
<p audio="3">
Note that the methods dealing with the score are common to <i>all</i> players
and are coded normally.
</p>
<p audio="4">
We would then have the always-cooperating player using inheritance
as we did with the other player classes:
</p>
<pre class="width70">
class Cooperator extends Player {

   public boolean cooperates ( ) {
      return true;
   }
}
</pre>
</body>
