Java has a special construct for an abstract class with <i>all</i> abstract methods
and no instance variables.  It's called an <span class="vocab">interface</span>.
We don't extend an interface; 
instead, we <i>implement</i> it, using the keyword <tt>implement</tt>.
In doing so, we promise to provide definitions for all the methods named in the interface.

You've seen this already in activities that handled mouse clicks.
Your class headers contained the phrase "<tt>implements MouseListener</tt>",
thus promising to provide implementations for five methods:
</p>
<pre class="width60">
void mouseClicked (MouseEvent e) 
void mouseEntered (MouseEvent e) 
void mouseExited (MouseEvent e) 
void mousePressed (MouseEvent e) 
void mouseReleased (MouseEvent e) 
</pre>
<p audio="3">
Recall that we generally provided only empty method bodies for <tt>mouseEntered</tt> and <tt>mouseExited</tt>.
That's enough to satisfy Java's requirements.
