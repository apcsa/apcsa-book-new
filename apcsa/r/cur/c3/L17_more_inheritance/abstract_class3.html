An abstract class can't be <span class="vocab" term="instantiate">instantiated</span>. 
<br/><br/>
It <i>can</i> be <span class="vocab" term="extend">extended</span>, however; 
if the subclass provides definitions for the abstract methods,
then <i>the subclass</i> can be instantiated.

<p audio="3" class="quoteBrown">
A class with abstract methods has to be declared as abstract.
A class that isn't abstract is <span class="vocab">concrete</span>.
