      <title>Another use for a static variable</title>

<p audio="1">
Another application that requires a static variable
is the maintenance of a counter that keeps track of how many objects in a class
have been instantiated.
Such a counter might be useful in a card game, where we would want to make sure
that a player isn't allowed to cheat by generating new cards beyond those
already in the deck.
</p>
<p>
Here's part of a Card <tt>class</tt> with a card counter 
and <tt>NUMSUITS</tt> and <tt>NUMRANKS</tt> constants.
Note the use of "our" in the static variable name rather than "my",
to indicate that the variable is shared among all the cards.

<pre>
public class Card {

   public static final int NUMSUITS = 4;
   public static final int NUMRANKS = 13;
   private int myRank;
   private int mySuit;
   private static int ourCardCounter = 0;
   private static final int MAXCARDS = 52;
   
   public Card (int rank, int suit) {
      if (rank &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; rank &lt; NUMRANKS) {
         myRank = rank;
      } else {
         ... // signal error
      }
      if (suit &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; suit &lt; NUMSUITS) {
         mySuit = suit;
      } else {
         ... // signal error
      }
      ourCardCounter++;
      if (ourCardCounter &gt; MAXCARDS) {
         ... // signal error
      }
   }
   
   ...
}
