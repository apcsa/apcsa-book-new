Some of you may know that Apple has long had requirements 
for the user interface of programs that run on the Macintosh.
For instance, each program that involves editing data is supposed to supply a "File" menu 
that includes elements "Open", "Close", and "Print", 
along with an "Edit" menu that includes elements "Copy", "Cut", and "Paste".
They supply library routines that simplify the setting up of these menus.
A program that obeys the guidelines presents a consistent interface to the user 
and is deemed "Mac-like".  
A program that doesn't obey the guidelines is "un-Mac-like", 
and may be harder to learn and use as a result.

Java interfaces support the same kind of consistency for programmers 
as the Macintosh user interface guidelines do for users.  
By specifying method headers, they tell the programmer exactly 
what to name his or her methods in order to coordinate 
with other parts of the Java class libraries.
