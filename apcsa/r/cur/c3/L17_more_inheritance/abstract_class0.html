Let's return now to the set of classes we wrote for the Prisoner's Dilemma simulation.
These formed the inheritance hierarchy shown below.

<table id="tableCenter">
	<tr>
		<th audio="4">
			Prisoner's Dilemma
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>

	</tr>
</table>

A flaw in this organization, however, is that the <tt>Player</tt> class is a player
on its own, one that always cooperates.
Thus the "is-a" relation between the other player classes and <tt>Player</tt> doesn't quite hold.
What the <tt>Player</tt> class should provide is a sort of placeholder 
for the <tt>cooperates</tt> method;
an inheriting class would then provide the details.
