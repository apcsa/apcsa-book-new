Static variables actually most commonly appear as static <span class="vocab" term="constant">constants</span>,
quantities that are assigned once and never changed thereafter.
For example, the various colors in the <tt>Color</tt> class 
(<tt>BLACK</tt>, <tt>WHITE</tt>, <tt>RED</tt>, etc.) are static constants.
</p>

As noted before, static quantities are associated with a class rather than with individual
objects.
A class representing bouncing objects might have a static constant representing
the value of gravity, since this constant would apply to all the bouncing objects.
A class representing standard playing cards might have a static constant
saying how many suits there are.
