BlueJ makes it easy to start a program by instantiating an object.
In order to run a program outside BlueJ, however, we must supply a static method
that does whatever object instantiation is appropriate.
This method is named "main"; its signature is
</p>
<pre>
public static void main (String [ ] args)
</pre>
<p>
(We'll explain the argument to <tt>main</tt> in a couple of weeks.)
</p>
<p>
A Java program is run outside BlueJ by giving the name of a class.
The Java system looks for a suitably defined <tt>main</tt> method in that class.
If <tt>main</tt> exists, it is run; otherwise an error is signalled.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>main</tt> method must be static because it is run before any objects are instantiated.
