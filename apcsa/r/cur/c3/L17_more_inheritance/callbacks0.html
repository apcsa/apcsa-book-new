It is common in Java for a method we provide to be called not by our own code 
but by someone else's.  
Two examples we've seen in earlier activities are 
the <tt>toString</tt> and <tt>mouseClicked</tt> methods.  
<tt>toString</tt> is rarely called directly.  
More likely, it is called by code that needs to produce a people-readable 
representation of an object, for instance, the <tt>System.out.print</tt> method. 
<tt>mouseClicked</tt>, as we have seen, is called by the Java system
when the mouse is clicked in a suitably initialized drawing window.
The situation where we call a method of a library class and 
another of our methods gets called as a result is referred to as a <i>callback</i>.

Another frequent participant in a callback is the <tt>equals</tt> method.
For example, the <tt>ArrayList contains</tt> method calls <tt>equals</tt> 
to determine if the argument to <tt>contains</tt> is an element of the list.
We will experiment with the <tt>equals</tt> method in the context of a <tt>Measurement</tt> class
that represents measurements in feet and inches.
