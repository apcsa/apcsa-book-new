      <title>Definition and use of static constants</title>
   </head>
   <body>
<p audio="1">
To declare a static constant, we use the keyword <tt>static</tt>.
A constant may be either public or private, depending on whether or not
it should be accessible from outside the class.
</p>
<p>
To declare a constant, we use the keyword <tt>final</tt> 
and use an initializer&mdash;an equals sign, followed by an associated value&mdash;to
provide the constant's value.
Assignments are not otherwise allowed to an identifier declared as <tt>final</tt>.
</p>
<p>
By convention, names of constants are written in all capital letters.
</p>
<p>
Thus, here's how a constant representing the number of suits would appear
in a <tt>Card</tt> class:
</p>
<pre>
public static final int NUMSUITS = 4;
</pre>
<p>
Within the class in which it's declared, a static constant may be accessed
by merely using its name, in the same way as instance variables.
From outside the class, we attach the class name and a dot to the front of the name,
for example,
</p>
<pre>
g.setColor (Color.RED);
for (int k=0; k&lt;Card.NUMSUITS; k++) ...
</pre>
