A better measure is <i>statement counting</i>.
The number of times a given statement in a program gets executed 
is independent of the computer on which the program is run 
and is probably the same for programs coded in closely related languages.

<div audio="2" class="quoteBrown">
Rather than count all statements in a method, we can usually pick out a few 
that represent the main work that the method is doing.

For a sorting method, the important aspects of efficiency
are the comparisons between <tt>ArrayList</tt> elements and the number of data movements
(assignments to <tt>ArrayList</tt> elements).
For the next couple of steps, you will add a private instance variable named
<tt>comparisonCount</tt> to the <tt>Deck</tt> class.
This variable should be set to 0 at the start of each sorting method,
incremented by 1 at each call to <tt>outranks</tt>,
and printed at the end of each sorting method.
