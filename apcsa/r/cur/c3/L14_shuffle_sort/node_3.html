<title>Checking results by hand</title>

<p>
To determine how many exchanges are necessary, we try some possibilities.
We examine as small a deck as necessary to give us the information we need. Even a deck of size 4 gives a large number of possibilities, so we start with a deck of size 3 whose cards are A, B, and C.
</p>
<p>
The table below displays the possibilities for one shuffle step. It includes all the cases for choosing two random integers between 0 and 2, inclusive.  (<tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt> are the variables in which the random numbers are stored.)
</p>
<table id="tableBlue">
<tr><td><tt>r1</tt></td><td><tt>r2</tt></td><td>resulting deck</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td align="center">A B C</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td align="center">B A C</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>2</td><td align="center">C B A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td align="center">B A C</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td align="center">A B C</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td align="center">A C B</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>0</td><td align="center">C B A</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td align="center">A C B</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td align="center">A B C</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This is not so good. There are three pairs of values that result in no change to the deck, and no pairs of values that produce the arrangements "B C A" or "C A B".
