After adding the <tt>comparisonCount</tt> variable 
to the <tt>Deck</tt> class as specified
in the preceding step, test the <tt>insertionSort</tt> 
method on three states of the Deck:
a deck already in sorted;
a deck just initialized so it is in suit-rank order;
and a deck that is shuffled.
Explain the results.</p>

        <div name="Joe">My comparison count turned out to be always between 3 and 6. When the deck is in order, you get three comparisons; when it's backward, you get 6.
