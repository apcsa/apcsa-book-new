The next step is to create a <tt>Deck</tt> method named <tt>shuffle</tt> that mixes up the cards
in an apparently unpredictable way.
This method should have the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">Any possible ordering of the deck should be possible.</li>
	<li audio="4">All orderings should be equally likely.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="5">We'll look at ways to do this in the next several steps.  You will, eventually,
write your own method to shuffle, but for now experiment and keep track of ideas in the
<tt>Deck</tt> class.</p>
