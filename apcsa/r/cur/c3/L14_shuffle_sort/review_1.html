In this lesson, we explored algorithms for two kinds of algorithms: shuffling ("un-sorting") and sorting.  Shuffling is of course useful for any kind of card game. Sorting is perhaps the most frequently occurring algorithm in any computer applications.
</p>
<p>
The idea of repeated <i>selection</i>&mdash;find and store the smallest, find and store the next smallest, and so on&mdash;turns out to be useful both for shuffling and for sorting ("selection sort" occurs frequently enough to be identifiable by name).
