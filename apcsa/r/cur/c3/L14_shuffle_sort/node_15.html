Here is the pseudocode from before, translated to work with a deck of cards.
</p>
<ol>
 <li audio="2">Initialize <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> to empty.</li>
<li>If <tt>myCards</tt> is nonempty, perform the sorting.</li>
<ol type="a"><li>Choose the lowest-ranking card in <tt>myCards</tt>.</li>
 <li audio="3">Remove it from <tt>myCards</tt> 
 and add it to the end of <tt>sortedSoFar</tt>.</li>
 <li audio="4">Repeat this process until no more elements remain in <tt>myCards</tt>.</li></ol></ol>
<p>
Suppose that the deck contains five cards, and consider the contents of <tt>myCards</tt> and <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> immediately after the <u>second</u> execution of step 2b. If the code is working correctly, several logical properties will be true at this point:
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>sortedSoFar</tt> contains two cards, and <tt>myCards</tt> contains three cards.</li>
<li>The cards in <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> are arranged in order from lowest-ranking to highest-ranking.</li>
<li>All the cards in the original <tt>myCards</tt> are in either the current <tt>myCards</tt> or in <tt>sortedSoFar</tt>, and all the cards in <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> and <tt>myCards</tt> are in the original <tt>myCards</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Give another property, different from those just listed, that relates the contents of <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> and the current <tt>myCards</tt>, and will be true if the algorithm is running correctly.
