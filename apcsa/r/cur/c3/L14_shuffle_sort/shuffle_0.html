         We will be using a <tt>Deck</tt>
         class whose instance variables include <tt>myCards</tt>, 
         an <tt>ArrayList&lt;Card&gt;</tt>.
         We start by initializing this deck.
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         The <tt>Deck</tt>
         constructor calls the method <tt>reset()</tt>. The method <tt>reset()</tt> should initialize the deck to
          be in perfect order:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="4">
           Initialize the <tt>myCards</tt> arraylist: <tt>myCards = new ArrayList<Card>();</tt>
         </li>
      
         <li audio="5">
            The top thirteen cards are the clubs, arranged from ace to king.
         </li>
         <li audio="6">
            The next thirteen cards are the diamonds, arranged in the same way.
         </li>
         <li audio="7">
            Next come the hearts, and finally the spades, arranged from ace to king.
         </li>
      </ul><br />
    <p audio="8">
         Note: Look at the <tt>toString()</tt> method in the <tt>Card</tt> class. It shows what integer values are mapped to what suits and ranks. It is zero-based as you might imagine. For ranks, 0 to 12 maps from Ace to King; for suits 0 to 3 maps to clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades.
