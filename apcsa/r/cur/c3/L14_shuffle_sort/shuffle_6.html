To get an unpredictable shuffle, we need to use a random number generator.
Two approaches come to mind:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="2">shuffling by exchanging, repeatedly choosing two cards at random and exchanging them, or</li>
	<li audio="3">shuffling by selection, randomly choosing a card and adding it to the shuffled deck 
	    until there are no more cards to be chosen.</li>
</ul>
