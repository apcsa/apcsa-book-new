How good is the "perfect" shuffle?
To analyze its behavior, let's assume that we have a deck of four cards, A, B, C, and D.
We split the deck in half: A B and C D. Then we interleave the two halves to get A C B D.
Doing this one more time get us back to the original deck!

Perhaps it works better with a bigger deck? 
Trying a deck of size 8 results in equally disappointing behavior:<br />
<table id="tableCenter">
	<tr>
		<td>After the first shuffle:</td> <td>A  E  B  F  C  G  D  H</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>After the second shuffle:</td> <td>A  C  E  G  B  D  F  H</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>After the third shuffle:</td> <td>A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H</td>
	</tr>
</table>

We conclude that a perfect shuffle is too predictable to satisfy the problem specifications, 
so we move on to alternative solutions.
