<title>Identifying the mystery sort</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
You run a sorting algorithm (using the debugger) on a deck of cards. After two iterations of the loop, you find that <tt>sortedSoFar</tt> contains
</p>
<pre>
   3&diams;  7&spades;
</pre>
<p>
and <tt>myCards</tt> contains
</p>
<pre>
   7&clubs;  9&hearts;
</pre>
<p>
Which algorithm are you running?
<ol type="a">
<li>selection sort</li>
<li>insertion sort</li>
<li>some other sorting algorithm that's not selection sort or insertion sort</li>
<li>either selection sort or insertion sort</li>
</ol>
<p>
Justify your answer. Also give all possibilities for the contents of <tt>myCards</tt> <i>before</i> the algorithm was run.
