<title>More ArrayList operations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
The methods we'll study soon use some <tt>ArrayList</tt> methods that we haven't yet encountered.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
We have used the single-argument <tt>add</tt> method already.
There is also a two-argument version.
Given two arguments, 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
an <tt>int</tt> position between 0 and <tt>size ( )</tt>, inclusive, and
</li>
<li>
a reference to an object,
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<tt>add</tt> inserts the given object at the given position. Elements are shifted up if necessary to make room for the new element. 
</p> 
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>remove</tt> takes one <tt>int</tt> argument, and removes the item at the argument's 
position in the list, shifting down all the subsequent elements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<tt>set</tt> takes two arguments, the first being a legal position in the list, the second a reference to store at that position.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
