    <div class="prompt">
    <p audio="1">
Over 20,000 students take the AP CS exam each year.
What sorting method would you use to sort the exams alphabetically by the name
of the test taker: insertion sort, selection sort,
or something else?
Briefly justify your choice.</p>

        <div name="Sherry">I assume each exam has an ID number. I would sort the exams into groups based on the first digit of its ID, then sort each group by the second digit, and so on.

        <div name="Joe">I wouldn't use insertion sort or selection sort; those would be too slow for 20000 exams. How about if we divided them in half, and sorted smaller piles, and then put them together?
