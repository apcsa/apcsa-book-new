Write a <tt>void</tt> method named <tt>perfectShuffle</tt> that simulates the way
many people shuffle a deck of cards.
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="2">First, the cards are split into two piles, with the same number of cards in each.</li>
	<li audio="3">Then, the two piles are interweaved as shown in the diagram below.</li>
</ul><br/>

This process is called a "perfect shuffle". It is typically repeated several times.
(We will shortly see that a perfect shuffle is really quite imperfect.)
</p>
<p audio="5">
In more detail, your method should perform as follows.
Suppose that there are <tt>k</tt> cards in <tt>myCards</tt>.
Your method should create two <tt>ArrayLists</tt>, one named <tt>topCards</tt>, consisting of
elements <tt>0</tt> through <tt>k/2&ndash;1</tt> of <tt>myCards</tt>, 
and the other named <tt>bottomCards</tt>,
containing elements <tt>k/2</tt> through <tt>k&ndash;1</tt> of <tt>myCards</tt>.
It should then interweave <tt>topCards</tt> and <tt>bottomCards</tt> 
into <tt>myCards</tt> as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li audio="6">element 0 from <tt>topCards</tt></li>
	<li audio="7">element 0 from <tt>bottomCards</tt></li>
	<li audio="8">element 1 from <tt>topCards</tt></li>
	<li audio="9">element 1 from <tt>bottomCards</tt></li>
	<li audio="10">etc.</li>
</ol>
