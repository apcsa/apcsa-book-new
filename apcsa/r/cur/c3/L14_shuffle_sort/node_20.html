<p>
We also considered the <i>efficiency</i> of the two sorting algorithms.
There are various ways to measure efficiency. Some measurements may vary, depending on the type of computer or version of Java we're using. A quantity that will be the same no matter what computer we use is <i>statement counts</i>.
</p>
<p>
The most interesting kind of statement to count in a sorting algorithm is the number of comparisons made to sort the collection of values.
We produced this count by adding an instance variable to the <tt>outranks</tt> method in the sorting code, and found two items of interest:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
For a given collection size, selection sort always involves the same number of comparisons, no matter what the arrangement of the elements of the collection.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For a given collection size, insertion sort does the same number of comparisons as selection sort <i>when the elements are in reverse order</i>. However, when the elements <i>are already in order</i>, insertion sort does substantially fewer comparisons.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
