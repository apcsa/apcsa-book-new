As you may have noted in the previous step,
one criterion for comparing two sorting methods
(or, for that matter, any two methods that produce the same output but in different ways)
is their <span class="vocab">efficiency</span>.
</p>
<p audio="2">
How do we measure the efficiency of a method?
One way is to time it.
Running times, however, will be affected by a variety of factors:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="3">the computer on which it runs;</li>
	<li audio="4">the Java programming environment used to compile it;</li>
	<li audio="5">the number of other programs running at the same time.</li>
</ul>
