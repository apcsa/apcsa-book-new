To determine how many exchanges are necessary, we try some possibilities. 
We examine as small a deck as necessary to give us the information we need; 
even a deck of size 4 gives a large number of possibilities, 
so we start with a deck of size 3. 
There are nine possible ways to make the first exchange; 
for each of those, there are nine possible ways to make the second exchange.
We create a diagram to determine all the possibilities, as shown below.
An exchange of, say, the first card with the second card is represented 
by "1&lt;-&gt;2" in the figure, 
an exchange of the second card with the third card is represented by "2&lt;-&gt;3," and so on. 
Potentially, the two randomly chosen positions might be identical.
The possibilities for this are "1&lt;-&gt;1," "2&lt;-&gt;2" and "3&lt;-&gt;3." 
All three possibilities merely result in the corresponding card being "exchanged" with itself.
