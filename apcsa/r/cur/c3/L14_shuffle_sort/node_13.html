<p>
All of the sorting methods we will examine use a <i>comparison</i> method that determines the order of two of the collection elements. In the upcoming steps, we'll be working with a deck of playing cards, so we now must define a comparison method for cards.
</p>
<p>
Provide, in the <tt>Card</tt> class, a method named <tt>outranks</tt> that returns true 
if either this <tt>Card</tt>'s rank is greater than the argument <tt>Card</tt>'s rank
or the two ranks are equal and this <tt>Card</tt>'s suit is higher than the argument card's suit.  The order of suits is clubs (lowest), diamonds, hearts, and spades (highest).
