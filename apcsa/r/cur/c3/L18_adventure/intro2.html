         Before looking at the Java code that we'll start with, 
         let's look at the BlueJ object diagram
         and talk about the classes in the program:

      <p audio="3">
         There are three main areas to this program, although each
         area contains two classes:
        
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="4">Getting the typed input from the user, and 
         interpreting it.  This functionality is in the <tt>InputGather</tt>
         and <tt>Command</tt> classes at the right of the diagram.
         Notice that these classes are related through inheritance.
         </li>
         <li audio="5">
            Representing the rooms and the connections 
            between them.  The <tt>Room</tt> and <tt>Path</tt>
            classes contain these functions.  We'll spend some time 
            extending the <tt>Room</tt> class to make more interesting
            rooms.
         </li>
         <li audio="6">
            Controlling the general play of the game.  The <tt>World</tt>
            and <tt>Player</tt> class set up the map for the game and 
            contain the  basic loop in the game: get a command from
            the user, print out information about what happens, and repeat.
         </li>
      </ul>
