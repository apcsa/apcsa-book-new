         Text adventure games need goals, and ways for the 
         player to reach those goals (and end the game). In this step, 
         you'll make a new subclass of <tt>Room</tt> that ends the 
         game when you enter it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p audio="3">First, how does a method end the game?  Examine the
      <tt>play</tt> method in the <tt>World</tt> class.  The loop stops
      when the <tt>isPlaying</tt> boolean instance variable is set to false. 
      That is a private instance variable (as it should be), so other objects
      won't be able to change it.  Rather, the <tt>World</tt> method <tt>gameOver</tt>
      lets any object turn the game off.

      <div class="talkBubble" char="float5" align="left" color="red">
         <p audio="4">So, the task is to create a new class that
         extends <tt>Room</tt> and calls <tt>gameOver</tt> when 
         it is entered?</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p audio="5">Precisely!  Do it now, and add a room (a bathroom?)
      where the player can find the inner peace she seeks.  (The next page
      has a few tips for you).
