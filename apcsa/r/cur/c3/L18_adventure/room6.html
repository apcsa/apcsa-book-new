    <div class="title">A room with a secret password</div>

    <div class="prompt">
    <p>Consider a room that requires a secret password before you can enter. That is, after the player types
the direction to enter the room, she is told that she has to enter a secret password. If she gets it
right, she successfully enters the room; if she gets it wrong, she is back where she started.
</p>
<p>How would you code this? (Tell us at a high level: which class you would extend, which methods you would 
override, and what your method would do). Don't worry about the details of how you would
collect the players input.
