            You'll want the <span class="vocab" term="overriding">overridden</span> 
            <tt>enterRoom</tt> method to 
            print out some information about why the game is suddenly
            ending.  Since entering this room always ends the game,
            you could do this in the description. 
            <br><br>
             Think about whether
            you should do this with a call to <tt>super.enterRoom()</tt>
            or simply a call to <tt>printDescription</tt>.  Both can work.

            Your new class will need a <tt>World</tt> instance variable
            so that it can call the <tt>gameOver</tt> method.  This means
            you will need a new <span class="vocab">constructor</span>.  
            Remember, you need to call
            <tt>super()</tt> as the first statement
             in your new constructor method.

            Don't forget to add your room with the <tt>World</tt> constructor,
            attach it to an existing room using the <tt>addExit</tt> method,
            and test it thoroughly!
