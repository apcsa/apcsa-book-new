         Examine the <tt>Room</tt>
         class in the <tt>Adventure_v0</tt>
         project. 
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         It is a relatively simple class.  It has three 
         instance variables:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="3a">
            <tt>name</tt>, a string
         </li>
         <li audio="3b">
            <tt>description</tt>, another string
         </li>
         <li audio="3c">
            <tt>exits</tt>, an <tt>ArrayList</tt> of <tt>Path</tt> 
            objects.  (Objects of the <tt>Path</tt> class connect two
            rooms with a particular <i>direction</i>.  The direction 
            associated with a <tt>Path</tt> is the name or
            direction of the exit from the current room.) 
         </li>
      </ul>
            <p audio="4">
         and only a few methods.  The methods that control
         movement between rooms include:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="4a">
            <tt>enterRoom</tt>, which prints the Rooms description
            and then returns a <tt>boolean</tt> value of
            <tt>true</tt>, indicating that the player 
            successfully entered the room.
         </li>
         <li audio="4b">
            <tt>exitRoom</tt>, which returns the <tt>boolean</tt>
            value <tt>true</tt>, indicating that the player is
            allowed to exit the room. 
         </li>
         <li audio="4c">
            <tt>tryToExit</tt>, which gets passed a <tt>String</tt>
            direction.  If the direction string matches one of the
            exit directions in the room, and the <tt>exitRoom</tt>
            method returns <tt>true</tt>, it then figures out
            the next room based on the <tt>Path</tt> objects
            <tt>travelDestination</tt> method.</li>  
      </ul>
      <p audio="5">And, all of this is controlled by the 
      <tt>actionTravel</tt> method in the <tt>Player</tt> class.</p>
