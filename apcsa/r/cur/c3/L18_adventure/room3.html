         The current Adventure program has several rooms in the world. 
         These are created in the <tt>World</tt>
         class with the 
         base class <tt>Room</tt>.  For instance, the code
      </p>
      <pre class="veryTightText">Room corridor = new Room(
  "The corridor", 
  "You're in a corridor connecting to the kitchen and the bedroom. The carpets are \n" +
  "stained, the light fixture in the ceiling is a bare bulb, and there are several \n" +
  "locked doors along its length.");
addRoom(corridor);
corridor.addExit(bedroom, "north");
corridor.addExit(kitchen, "south");</pre>
<p audio="2b">
   adds the room <i>Corridor</i> to the game.  Note that the description is
   very long, and to make it fit into the editor window it is constructed
   from several strings.  The <tt>\n</tt> at the end of each string
   forces <tt>System.out.println</tt> to start a new line (think "<b>n</b>
   for <b>n</b>ewline").
</p>
      <p audio="3">
      Objects made from the <tt>Room</tt>
      class will all have the same functionality, and only differ
      in their name and descriptions.  Lets see what we can do by 
      extending the <tt>Room</tt> class.

         In the next step, you'll work on ending the game 
        (and telling the player that they've won or lost).
