<p audio="3">Text adventures are games in which a player reads descriptions about their virtual surroundings, and then types text commands 
in English to interact with the game.  Early adventure games (e.g., <i>Zork</i>) had no pictures or graphics at all; the
player had to read the text and visualize the scenes using their imagination.</p>

<p audio="4" class="quoteblue">The first text-based adventure game, still held in high esteem, was called <i>Colossal Cave</i>,
and was written around 1970. Try searching the Internet for <i>Colossal Cave Adventure</i> and you should find several
playable examples.</p>

<p audio="5">Text adventures generally have the notion of a <i>room</i>: at any one point in the game, the player is in a
particular room. Rooms are linked to each other, allowing the player to move about in the game with typed commands like "go
south" or "enter kitchen".  Typically, the player needs to solve puzzles by interacting with objects and people in the various rooms.
