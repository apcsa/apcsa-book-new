         Whoa, why are there all these different methods checking
         whether the player can move?  Why not just have a single 
         method that returns the next room?

            In one word, the reason is <span class="vocab">inheritance</span>.  If we want
            to make special rooms that do complicated things, we'll
            make new classes that extend <tt>Room</tt>.  
            <br><Br>
            By having
            this parent class go through a specific sequence of 
            methods, our new <span class="vocab">subclass</span> can change what happens in 
            specific ways by <span class="vocab">overriding</span> one of those methods.
