        Spend the rest of your time in this lesson adding to the
        <tt>Adventure</tt> project, or starting a new one.  Think up
        a clever idea and write some special rooms and items that
        subclass of off <tt>Room</tt> and <tt>Item</tt>.

         You may have more ideas than time.  That's ok; you'll have 
         a chance to revist this project at the end of the course,
         when you choose a <b>Big Project</b> to work on.  (This comes
         after the AP test).
