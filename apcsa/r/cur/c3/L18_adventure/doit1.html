         <li audio="4">
            Make and item that has states that change as the user
            interacts with them (e.g., a balloon that pops).
         </li>
         <li audio="5">
            Make a room with an exit that only becomes visible when 
            a certain item is held by the player.
         </li>         
                  <li audio="6">
            Make an exit of a room a "random transporter".  When the
            player uses it, it puts him in a random room.  You'll want
            to subclass <tt>Path</tt> for this one (think about which
            method you want to override...).  And, you'll have to change
            the <tt>TransporterPath</tt> constructor so that it stores 
            a reference to the <tt>World</tt> object, so it can choose
            a room.
         </li>
         <li audio="7">
            Make an item that can be used with another item to make
            something totally different.
         </li>
         </ul>
