                In this lesson, you'll be working with a larger and
                more complicated program. Your earlier work mainly involved programs
                with one or two classes; the program you'll see shortly has four and,
                in a later version, five. Each class contains code that logically
                belongs together, but they interact in complicated ways to make the
                program work as it should.

                We hope you will learn skills in navigating through the code in
                several classes, seeing how the objects interact, and identifying
                locations to make modifications in the program. Also, we hope you
                learn something about <span class="vocab" term="simulation">simulations</span>.
