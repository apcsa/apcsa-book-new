If you were a player, wouldn't it be nice to get the car every time?
Since we have control over the simulation, let's do it!
</p>
<p audio="3">
Monty keeps the location of the car in an instance variable.
Right now, that variable is private.
Monty is pretty smart:
it probably isn't a good idea to let just anybody know that value.
However, <i>we</i> can make it accessible to the <tt>Player</tt>.
</p>
<ol>
<li audio="4">
Make the <tt>doorWithCar</tt> instance variable <tt>public</tt> instead of <tt>private</tt>.  
Poor Monty.

</li>
<li audio="5">

Modify the <tt>Player</tt> class to take advantage of this change.  
That is, fix it to ensure that the player always chooses the door with the car.
</li>
</ol>
<p audio="6">
Now play the game and test your change.  Does it work?  
You won't get to choose the door the first time because of your change.  
It should, however, be pretty obvious whether to switch or stay ...  
</p>
<p audio="7">
When making an instance variable or method, 
your choice of <tt>public</tt> or <tt>private</tt> can have repercussions 
on how your code is used!
