        <title>A program to model the Monty Hall problem</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="2">
The program <tt>MontyHall</tt> models the interaction
between Monty and the contestant.
It consists of four classes:
</p>
<ul audio="3">
	<li>the <tt>Monty</tt> class, whose constructor starts the program;</li>
	<li>the <tt>Contestant</tt> class;</li>
	<li>the <tt>Controller</tt> class, which manages the display;</li>
	<li>the <tt>Stage</tt> class, which forms a part of the display.</li>
</ul>
<div class="openbluejproj" project="MontyHall" audio="4">
<p>Open the <b>MontyHall</b> project.</p>
<p>
Instantiate a <tt>Monty</tt> object,
then run the <tt>playGame</tt> method to play the game once.
You'll be asked to click on a door,
then to click on a door again (either the door you've already chosen,
or a different door if you want to switch).
Play additional games by calling the <tt>playGame</tt> method.
In these games, try to determine from your runs whether switching
is better than not switching, or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Tally your results and record them in the next step's brainstorm.
