        <div name="Sherry">The hard part is using the random number r to pick one of the unchosen values. When chosenDoor is 3, r picks one of the first two doors; that's the easy case. When chosenDoor is 1, r picks one of the second and third doors. That's another relatively easy case. When r is to be used to choose between door 1 and door 3, things get complicated and I had to resort to the table values.
