    <div class="prompt">
    <p>
Suppose <tt>goatDoorToShow</tt> always returns the <i>first</i> door with a goat rather than a random door with a goat. What is the effect of this change on the ability of the contestant to win?

        <div name="Joe">I think it will act the same as the original, even though the selection is a little less "random".

        <div name="Sherry">If I knew that Monty would always show me the first door with a goat, then if Monty showed me door number 2, I know the car is in door #1. So if that change is made and I know about it, I have better odds for the car.
