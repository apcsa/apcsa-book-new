The game show "Let's Make a Deal" was a popular television program
from the 1960's through the 1990's.
It has been rebroadcast off and on since then.
The host of the show was Monty Hall, pictured at the right.

Each episode 
involved several "deals" between Monty and members of the audience who
were choosen as contestants.  At the end of each episode, the most successful 
contestant was given a special chance to earn a large prize (a car, for instance).  
</p><p>
The "deal" looked simple enough to most people: 
</p>
<div class="quotebrown" audio="3">
<p>
On the stage were three closed doors. 
Behind one of them was the expensive prize. 
Behind the other two were essentially worthless prizes; once in a while these were 
actual goats, so let's just call them all goats.  Then:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Monty asked the contestant to choose a door. 
</li>
<li>He then opened one of the other two doors, revealing a goat. 
</li>
<li>The contestant was then allowed to change her guess. 
This was the big challenge: should she stick with the door she chose originally, 
or switch to the other closed door?
</li>
<li>Once that was settled, Monty opened all the doors,
and the contestant ended up either with a car or a goat.</li>
</ul>
