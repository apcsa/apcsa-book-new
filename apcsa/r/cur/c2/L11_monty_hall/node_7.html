A mouse click early in the program must be handled quite differently from a click later in the program&mdash;the first click selects from three doors, while the second click represents switching or staying with the choice already made.
</p>
<p audio="3">
This difference is represented with the <span class="vocab">state variable</span> 
named (appropriately) <tt>state</tt>.
A state-based process moves from one situation,
or <span class="vocab">state</span> to another,
with the state variable keeping track of what state the process is in.
An example is a three-state traffic light: it's either red, or yellow, or green.
Mouse click handling in this program is also a state-based process whose states are
</p>
<ul>
<li audio="4">waiting for an initial door selection;</li>
<li audio="5">waiting for a switch-or-stay click;</li>
<li audio="6">resolving the outcome.
</ul>
<p audio="7">
The corresponding code has the following form.
</p>
<pre class="width60">
   if (state == INITIAL_STATE) {
         ...
      state = SWITCHSTAY_STATE;
         ...
   } else if (state == SWITCHSTAY_STATE) {
         ...
      state = DONE_STATE;
         ...
   }
</pre>
