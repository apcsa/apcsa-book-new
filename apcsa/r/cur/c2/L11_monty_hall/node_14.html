    <div class="title">Generalizing from limited data</div>

    <div class="prompt">
    <p audio="1">

In an earlier activity, you ran the program a few times

and attempted to generalize from the results

about which strategy is best.

Explain how the results of just a few runs

might lead to a misleading conclusion,

and suggest how many runs would be necessary to convince you.</p>

        <div name="Sherry">I ran 10 of each, and switching did a lot better (8 out of 10). Both strategies did well, though; not switching got 6 right out of 10.  I think I need more runs--maybe 100?--because if switching had won one fewer time and not switching had won one more time, the two strategies would have gotten the same number of wins.
