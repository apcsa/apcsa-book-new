         The <tt>Eye</tt>
         class is quite a bit more complicated than, well, perhaps 
         anything you've seen so far.  Let's look at the big picture first.
      </p>
      <p audio="3" class="quoteBrown">
         The <tt>Eye</tt>
         object handles the drawing of one eyeball.

      <ul>
            <li audio="6">
            
                  In order to keep track of what an eye looks like, objects 
                  from the <tt>Eye</tt>
                  class 
                  have quite a few instance variables.  The statement
         
<pre class="tightText">int eyeX, eyeY, eyeWidth, eyeHeight, eyeCenterX,
 				eyeCenterY, pupilX, pupilY;</pre>
         
                  is a shortcut for creating several instance variables of the same type. 
                  It defines 8 variables. 
      
         </li>
 <li audio = "7">
            An eye knows how to draw itself, based on values of those instance
            variables, and does so through the <tt>draw</tt>
            method.  Basically, an "eye" is three <tt>fillOval</tt> 
            methods.  Pay some attention to how the various instance variables
            define the dimensions that make up an eye.
