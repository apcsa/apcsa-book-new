         One of the earliest graphical 
         <span class="vocab" term="windowing system">windowing systems</span>
          was developed 
         
         by researchers in the 1980s.  It is called the <span class="vocab">XWindows</span>,
         and has useful features that are uncommon on most personal computers 
         today.  It is still in use in many places.

         The XWindows system contains many little programs that use its
         graphical features.  One whimsical little program is called 
         <i>XEyes</i>, which draws two eyes on the computer screen and 
         makes the pupils follow the mouse cursor as it moves.  The 
         effect is quite ... interesting.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         For the next several steps, we are going to work on a Java
         version of XEyes, and will add several features that the 
          XWindows version does not have.  This project is designed to 
          give you practice in Java graphics and listeners.
