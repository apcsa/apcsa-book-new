            Wait, an <tt>Eye</tt>
            object knows how to draw itself? 
            I've been paying attention, and it doesn't extend <tt>JPanel</tt>.
            So how can it draw itself?

            Good question.   Remember that the <tt>XEyes paintComponent</tt>
            method called the <tt>Eye draw</tt>
            method.  So, <tt>draw</tt>, then, acts just like an <tt>Eye</tt>
            <tt>paintComponent</tt>
            method.  As such, it is a <span class="vocab">callback</span>
            method.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Also, remember that when <tt>draw</tt>
            was called by the <tt>XEyes paintComponent</tt>
            method, it passed along the <tt>Graphics</tt>
            object it got as a <span class="vocab">parameter</span>. 
            The <tt>draw</tt>
            method can use that object to call <tt>fillOval</tt>
            and so forth. 
         </p>

         <p audio="7.m1">
            Because that <tt>Graphics</tt>
            object was made by the <tt>JPanel</tt>'s <tt>paintComponent</tt>, 
            any method <i>in any class</i>
            can use it to draw 
            on that <tt>JPanel</tt>.  Tricky!
