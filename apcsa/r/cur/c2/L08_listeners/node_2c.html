      <p audio="2.m2">Wait, I have to use <span class="vocab">extends</span> at some points  
         and <span class="vocab">implements</span> at others? </p>
      <p audio="3.m2">What is the difference between the two? 
         Is there any rhyme or reason to Java!?</p>

      <p audio="4.f1">Well, yes, if there is one thing Java has, it is a 
         reason for everything you must do. </p>
      <p audio="5.f1">Both <tt>extends</tt> and <tt>implements</tt> do similar 
      things in your program, helping you
         use other classes you might not have written.</p>
      <p audio="6.f1">For now, just 
         remember that you <tt>extend</tt> a <tt>JPanel</tt>, 
         but <tt>implement</tt> a <tt>MouseListener</tt>.</p>
      <p audio="7.f1">There are differences between what these 
         two keywords do. 
         You'll learn all about them and how they 
         work in a few weeks when we look at <span class="vocab">inheritance</span>.</p>
