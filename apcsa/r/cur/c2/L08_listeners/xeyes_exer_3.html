      <title>Exercise: creating eyes by dragging</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="2" class="quoteBrown">
         Putting the exact dimensions of each eye into the <tt>XEyes</tt>
         constructor 
         is a hassle, especially when you use a different image.  Let's make it so  
         you can place an eye by clicking and dragging the mouse.  Save your work in a 
         BlueJ project titled <tt>XEyes_drag</tt>.
      </p>
      <p audio="3">
         This will take several changes to the <tt>XEyes</tt>
         class, but none to the <tt>Eye</tt>
         class.  Here are some hints on how to proceed:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio = "4">
            <p>If we are going to set the coordinates of the eye by clicking our mouse
			  we need to remove the "hard-coded" coordinates passed arguments to the Eye constructor in 
			  the XEyes constructor.
			  
			  <pre>public XEyes()
{
   ...
   <span class="strike">eye_1 = new Eye(...);</span>  //remove this line
   <span class="strike">eye_2 = new Eye(...);</span>  //remove this line too!
   ...	
}
			  </pre>
			   You will need to put a conditional in 
               <tt>draw</tt> to only draw the eye if it has been created. 
               			  			
               But, how do you test for that?
            </p>
            <p>
               The easiest way is to set each instance variable to <span class="vocab" term="null"><tt>null</tt></span>
               initially.
            </p>
            <pre>Eye eye_1 = null;</pre>
            <p>
               <tt>null</tt>
               is, essentially, the "empty" object. 
            </p>
            <p>   
               You can test for eye_1 or eye_2 being null in the paintComponent method
			   by setting up these conditional:
            </p>
            <pre>if (eye_1 == null) {
   ...
   }</pre>
        	 <pre>if (eye_2 == null) {
   ...
   }</pre>
         </li>
         <li audio="5">
            You can specify the size of the eye by checking the difference 
            between the events of the <tt>mousePressed</tt>
            and <tt>mouseReleased</tt>
            methods.  You did this in this lesson in an earlier step.</p>
         </li>
        
      </ul>
      <p audio="10" class="quoteBrown">Two things you might want to add.  First,
      you might want to ensure that there is a minimum size for an eye.  Use a 
      conditional just before you create the eye.
      <br /><br />
         Second, you might create more eyes.  Why stop at 2?
