         What else is there?</p>
      </div>
      
      <p audio="3">Right.  You use <span class="vocab" term="implements"><tt>implements</tt></span> to tell Java that your 
         class can deal with mouse events.  But, you also need to tell Java that 
         you want those events sent to your mouse methods. </p>
      <p audio="4">
      You do this by calling the method <tt>addMouseListener</tt>, 
      usually in the <span class="vocab">constructor</span>
      for your class: </p>
      <pre class="width80">
public SimpleClicker() extends JPanel implements MouseListener ... {
      ...
   addMouseListener (this);
      ...
}</pre>
      <p audio="5">This is called <span class="vocab" term="register">registering</span> your object for mouse events.  (Remember, in the constructor, <tt>this</tt> refers to 
         the new object being created.)</p>
