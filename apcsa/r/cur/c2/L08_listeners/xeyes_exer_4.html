      <title>Exercise: handling mouse <i>motion</i> events</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="2">
         The original xeyes program made the eye pupils follow the mouse 
         as it was moved, not just when it was clicked.  This makes things much
         cooler, so lets do it.
      </p>
      <p audio="3" class="quoteBrown">
         Make the pupil follow every move of the mouse, rather then just 
         the position at which it is clicked.  Save your work in the  
         BlueJ project titled <tt>XEyes_motion</tt>.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         If you think a bit about this, you should realize that there is no 
         possible way to do it.  When implementing <tt>mouseListener</tt>, 
         you only get click events (and enter/exit events, which won't help).  
         You are right! 
      </p>
      <div audio="5">
         <p>
         What you need is a new kind of listener.  Specifically, a <tt>MouseMotionListener</tt>. 
         This is very much like the good old <tt>MouseListener</tt>, but requires different methods to be present:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <tt>mouseMoved</tt>: this method will be called everytime the mouse
                  is moved while over the graphical object, even if by one pixel.  Perfect!
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                  <tt>mouseDragged</tt>: this will be called after a mouse has been pressed
                  and moved.  It will continue to be called everytime the mouse moves,
                  until the mouse button is released.  Interesting, but not useful here.
               </p>
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Like the <tt>MouseListener</tt>
            methods, these two are called with a <tt>MouseEvent</tt>
            object. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="5b">A class can implement two different <span class="vocab" term="interface">interfaces</span> at once.  Simply
      list each interface, separated by commas, after the <tt>implements</tt> keyword. It should look like this:
      <pre>public class XEyes extends JPanel implements MouseListener,MouseMotionListener{
      </pre>
      <p audio="5c">
      You will also need to be sure to add the mouse motion listener to the object in the <tt>XEyes</tt> constructor:
	  </p>
	  <pre>public XEyes(){
	...
	addMouseMotionListener(this);
	...
}
      </pre>
      
     <p audio="5d">
      And finally, implement the mouse motion listener contracted methods in the XEyes class:</p>
	  <pre>public void mouseMoved(MouseEvent e){ ... }
public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e){ ... }
</pre>
      
	  
      <p audio="5e">
      So, consider integrating the laser vision with this exercise.
