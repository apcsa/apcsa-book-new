      <title>Exercise: Centering the pupil when clicking in the eye</title>
   </head>
   <body>

      <p audio="2">
         Try and see what happens when you click right inside an eyeball.
         Really, this looks terrible.  The problem is that the <tt>movePupil</tt>
 method only draws the pupils along the outside rim of the eye.  
      </p>
      <p audio="3" class="quoteBlue">
         When clicking inside the eyeball, we should draw the pupil
         directly on the click.  Save your work in a BlueJ project titled
         <tt>XEyes_center</tt>.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         To do this exercise, we'll only need to modify the <tt>Eye</tt> class.
         Specifically, we'll only need to change the <tt>movePupil</tt>
         method, which takes in the coordinates of the mouse click and 
         sets the <tt>pupilX</tt> and <tt>pupilY</tt> instance variables,
         which hold the pupil's current position.
         
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         All you need to do is add an <tt>else if(...)</tt> case to the <tt>if-else</tt> chain in <tt>movePupil</tt> 
         that tests if the mouse click was inside the eye and if so, sets pupilX and pupilY appropriately.
      </p>
      <p audio="6">Use the following method to test if a point is inside 
      the eye (derived from the formula of an ellipse):</p>
      <pre class="width70">public boolean inEye () {
        double dist = square(mouseX - eyeCenterX) / square(eyeWidth/2-pupilRadius) 
                 + square(mouseY - eyeCenterY) / square(eyeHeight/2-pupilRadius);
        return (dist <= 1);    
}</pre>
      <p audio="7">
         We'll leave you to write the method <tt>square</tt>, which returns 
         a number times itself.  Make sure you have <tt>square</tt> return 
         a double, because the <tt>inEye</tt> method won't work with 
         integer arithmetic!
