      <p audio="b">The mouse event handling that we are going to start 
         with involves several <span class="vocab">callback</span> methods:</p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="c">
            <tt>mousePressed</tt>
            handles a press of the mouse button;
         </li>
         <li audio="d">
            <tt>mouseReleased</tt>
            handles a release of the mouse button;
         </li>
         <li audio="e">
            <tt>mouseClicked</tt>
            handles a mouse click (a press and release at the same spot);
         </li>
         <li audio="f">
            <tt>mouseEntered</tt>
            handles a move of the mouse to this drawing window;
         </li>
         <li audio="g">
            <tt>mouseExited</tt>
            handles a move of the mouse from inside  this window to outside this window.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p audio="h">(We will concern ourselves mainly with the first three of these.)</p>
      <p audio="i">All of these methods are callbacks. 
         Like the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method in earlier activities,
         we never call these mouse event handlers ourselves. 
         Instead, the underlying Java system calls the relevant event 
         handler when the event happens.</p>
      <p audio="j" class="quoteBlue">So, for instance, you write the method
      <tt>mouseClicked</tt>, and it will be called every time the mouse button 
         is clicked. </p>
