         Let's create some buttons to help control
         a turtle graphics widow.  The turtle graphics engine was
         presented as an exercise in Lesson 7, near the end.
      </p>
      <p audio="2a">
         You'll need to draw a control panel at the top of the window:
      </p>
      <table id="tableBlue">
         <tr>
            <td>
               forward
            </td>
            <td>
               turn right
            </td>
            <td>
               raise pen
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p audio="3">
         When first initialized, the graphics window should be blank. 
         When one of the buttons in the control panel is clicked, 
         the relevant command should be given to the turtle.  For instance, 
         if "forward" is clicked, then the turtle should move forward 
         in its current direction, drawing a line if the pen is down.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         The text of the 'last' control should change based on the state
         of the pen.  If the pen is down, it should appear as above, containing
         "raise pen".  When the pen is up,
         "lower pen" should appear.
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         The turtle should not be allowed to move off the screen or into the control panel.
      </p>
