      <p audio="1">Adding a mouse listener is easy, but there is a slight complication. 
       The <tt>addMouseListener</tt> method 
         is only present in classes that have a graphical representation, like
         a <tt>JPanel</tt>.  
In upcoming activities, we will work with classes that
extend the <tt>JPanel</tt> library class, just as we did
in the previous lesson.
