      You have probably noticed that each of the mouse methods 
      (e.g., <tt>mouseClicked</tt>)
      gets a single <span class="vocab">argument</span>
      of 
      the class <tt>MouseEvent</tt>.  This object contains 
      information about the mouse click that might be useful.
   </p>
   <p audio="2">
      The <tt>MouseEvent</tt>
      object has two 
      methods that allow us to determine where in the  
      drawing window the mouse was clicked, pressed, 
      or released: <tt>getX</tt>
      and <tt>getY</tt>. 
      The <tt>getX</tt>
      method returns the column 
      coordinate and the <tt>getY</tt> method
      returns the 
      row coordinate.
   </p>
   <div audio="3" class="tryit">
   	<p>
      Copy the <tt>Clicker</tt>
      class into a new class called <tt>CircleClicker</tt>, and
      modify it so that for each click it draws a red 
      circle at the location
      of the click.  </p>
