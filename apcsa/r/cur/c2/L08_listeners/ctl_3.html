         Simulate the clicking of a two-digit counter.
         The drawing window should appear as follows:
      </p>
      <table id="tableBlue">
         <tr>
            <td>
               7
            </td>
            <td>
               9
            </td>
            <td>
               ^
            </td>
            <td>
               V
            </td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p audio="3">
         Clicking on the "^" should increase the displayed value by 1. 
         For instance, if the current counter was as shown above, clicking on 
         the "^" would change the counter to <tt>8 0</tt>.
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         Conversely, clicking on "V" should decrease the displayed value by 1.
         The displayed value should "wrap around": incrementing 99 should produce 00,
         and decrementing 00 should produce 99.
      </p>
            <p audio="5">
         A tip: keep track of the current counter value in an
         <tt>int</tt> instance variable. You can determine the left
         digit by dividing by 10, and the right digit by using the 
         remainder, or <span class="vocab">modulus</span>, operator: <tt>%</tt>.
      </p>
