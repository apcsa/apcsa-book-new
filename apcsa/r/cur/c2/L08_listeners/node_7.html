         In the previous example, you'll have noticed 
         that the red circles started to build up in the window.  
         This might give you pause, because the <tt>paintComponent</tt>
         method was drawing only a single circle each time.  You saw 
         a similar effect in the original <tt>Clicker</tt>
         class: 
         the "you tickled me" messages we building up on the screen,  
         even though the <tt>paintComponent</tt>
         method was calling <tt>drawString</tt>
         only once.

         The reason for this is that the graphics 
         window isn't getting <i>erased</i>
         between clicks. 
         Java is being  
         efficient, and won't redraw the whole 
         window unless it has to.  (In fact, it is hard to get 
         Java to redraw the whole screen.  On most computers, dragging 
         the window off the screen and then back onto it won't do it. 
         One way that is often successful is to 'maximize' the window,  
         or resize it in some way).

         A guaranteed way to clear the screen is to draw a rectangle 
         that is the size of the window at the beginning of your <tt>paintComponent</tt>
         method, and follow it by whatever 
         drawing you originally wanted to do.  Use <tt>fillRect</tt>, 
         with an upper left corner at <tt>0,0</tt>
         and a lower right 
         corner that is the same as the size of the window. 
      </p>
      <div class="tryit">
         <p class="5">
         Make a new class called <tt>ClearClicker</tt>, copying from 
         one of your other classes. In this class, draw a string  
         at a fixed spot each time the mouse is clicked that says
		 <br /><br/>
         <tt>"You tickled me at (X,Y)"</tt>
         <br /><br />
		 
         where <tt>X</tt>
         and <tt>Y</tt>
         are replaced with the coordinates
         of the click.  Make sure you erase the screen between clicks.
