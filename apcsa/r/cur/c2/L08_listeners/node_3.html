      <p audio="2">Since we have a graphical object (the <tt>JPanel</tt>, in the case of <tt>SimpleClicker</tt>), it makes sense to combine the mouse handling 
         with graphic output.</p>
      <p audio="3">As with the work we did in the last lesson, this 
         means including a <tt>paintComponent</tt> callback method. 
         There is an extra wrinkle, however: we are likely to need to  
         change the graphics in response to a mouse click.  That is, 
         we need to have some control over when the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method is run.</p>
      <p audio="4">We aren't allowed to call <tt>paintComponent</tt> directly; 
         anyway, how  
         could we make the <tt>Graphics</tt> object that it takes as 
         an argument?  Rather, we can call a method <tt>repaint</tt>, 
         which takes no arguments, and forces Java to immediately  
         update the screen. </p>
      <p audio="5">Because we aren't calling <tt>paintComponent</tt> directly, we 
         can't pass any information to it.  Therefore, if we want to 
         use something known in the mouse event&mdash;say, 
         the coordinate where the mouse was clicked&mdash;that information 
         has to be stored in an instance variable.  That is,  
         the mouse method stores the information, and then 
         the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method reads it.</p>

            How is information being shared between <tt>mouseClicked</tt> and
