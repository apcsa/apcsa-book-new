         Let's make a quick change to the Eye class by giving Albert Einstein 
         laser beams that shoot out of his eyes.  We'll do this by drawing a red line 
         from the center of each pupil to the location of the mouse click.  Save your work 
         in a project titled <tt>XEyes_laser</tt>.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p audio="3">
         It is clear that we'll use the <tt>mouseClicked</tt>
         method to find out
         both when and where the mouse was clicked.  The drawing will happen, however, 
         in the <tt>Eye</tt>
         classes's <tt>draw</tt>
         method. 
      </p>
      <p audio="4">
         We can't pass in the 
         click coordinates directly into the <tt>draw</tt>
         method, however; the <tt>draw</tt>
         method gets 
         triggered by the callback method <tt>paintComponent</tt>
         in the XEyes class.
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         The right approach is the store the last mouse click location into some 
         instance variables, and modify the draw method to use those instance 
         variables to draw a line.  Something like:
      </p>
      <pre class="width30">private int clickedX;
private int clickedY;</pre>
      
      <p audio="6">
         A hint: the center of the pupil is stored in the <tt>Eye</tt>s <tt>pupilX</tt>
         and <tt>pupilY</tt>
         instance variables.
