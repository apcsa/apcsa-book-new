      <p audio="2.f1">The first step is to write the relevant mouse 
      interaction (e.g., <tt>mouseClicked</tt>) 
      method.</p>
      <p audio="3.f1">However, it is not enough to just include 
      the method in your class.  You have to tell Java that your  
      class is both set up to deal with events <i>and</i>
      wants to receive those events.</p>
   </div>
   <br/>
   <p audio="4" class="quoteBlue">How do you tell Java that your class can deal with events?</p>
   <p audio="5">In a similar way to how we used graphics classes such as <tt>JPanel</tt>,
      we need to tell Java that our class can act like another class.  We are going to use another special keyword 
      in this case: the <tt>implements</tt> keyword.  This is used in the 
      <span class="vocab">class header</span>, like <tt>extends</tt>.
     
      The thing that we will implementing, in this case, is a <tt>MouseListener</tt>.  So, if we were writing a class called <tt>SimpleClicker</tt> that needed to deal with mouse events, we 
      would write:</p>
   <pre class="width80">public class SimpleClicker implements MouseListener {
   ... 
}</pre>
   <p audio="6">What is <tt>MouseListener</tt>?  It is capitalized like 
      a class, but it is actually an <span class="vocab">interface</span>, something somewhat 
      different.  You can think of an interface as a <i>contract</i>.  That is,
      if you say a class "implements" an interface, that means you have to include 
      certain specific methods in your class.  For the <tt>MouseListener</tt> interface, 
      that means the five methods in the previous page: <tt>mousePressed</tt>, <tt>mouseReleased</tt>, <tt>mouseClicked</tt>, <tt>mouseEntered</tt>, 
      and <tt>mouseExited</tt>.  Easy!
(Incidentally, you can look in the online Java documentation to find which methods you have to provide when using an interface
in the Java class library.)</p>
    <p audio="7" class="quoteBrown">We'll learn more about interfaces when we get to the 
    unit on <span class="vocab">inheritance</span>.</p>
