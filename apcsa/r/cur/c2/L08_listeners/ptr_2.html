         Write a "stamp pad" program for images.
         The program will start by reading an image from a file
         whose location is specified by the user.
         Then, at each mouse click, it will display a copy of the image
         in the drawing window at the clicked-on position.
      </p>

Recall that reading images was also done in the Virtual Pet lesson.
