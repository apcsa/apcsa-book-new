<p>
Exercises focus on two roles for mouse clicks:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>mouse as pointer</i>, where the position of the mouse click
on the screen is important; and </li>
<li><i>mouse as controller</i>, where the mouse click is used to signal
some change of state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Often a mouse click plays both roles, for example, when it is used to 
identify a "button" somewhere on the screen, then to change state
depending on the role of the "button".
