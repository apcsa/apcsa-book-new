<p>
Much of the program resembles the graphics code we saw in lesson 7.
For example, we see
</p>
<pre>
public class <i>class name</i> extends JPanel ...
</pre>
<p>
as before. The first few statements of the constructor should be familiar as well.
To access the graphics classes, we used <tt>import</tt> statements
at the start of the program. We add another <tt>import</tt> statement
to access mouse event handler methods.
The <tt>paintComponent</tt> is what draws on the screen as in earlier code.
</p>
<p>
A feature of Java that we saw for the first time here is an <span class="vocab">
interface</span>.
A Java interface sets up a <i>contract</i> in which the user of the interface
promises to set up a given set of callback methods.
We use the <tt>implements</tt> keyword to agree to that contract.
Here, we agree to a contract about handling mouse clicks,
promising that we will supply methods <tt>mouseClicked</tt>,
<tt>mouseReleased</tt>, <tt>mousePressed</tt>, <tt>mouseEntered</tt>,
and <tt>mouseExited</tt>. (We only actually use <tt>mouseClicked</tt>.)
</p>
<p>
Finally, here are two more details.
We connect the listener methods to the Java runtime system with the statement
</p>
<pre>
addMouseListener (this);
</pre>
<p>
placed in the constructor.
When the <tt>mouseClicked</tt> method is called,
it can call <tt>repaint</tt> to redraw the screen.
