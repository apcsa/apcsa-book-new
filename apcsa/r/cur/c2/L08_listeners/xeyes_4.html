         One thing that makes the <tt>Eye</tt>
         class fairly daunting is all of 
         the ... <i>math</i>.  In order to place the pupil correctly, the <tt>Eye</tt>
         class 
         uses some geometry formulas that may look even worse than when you 
         did them in geometry class!
      </p>
      <p audio="3">A lot of computer programs use <span class="vocab">mathematical modeling</span>,
      which basically means using math to describe something in a real (or virtual)
      world.  We hope, though, that if you dislike math, the neat applications 
      that you can do with computers will make math seem cool, rather than 
      programming seem like math.  For instance:

      <ul>
      
            <li audio="4">
               Mathematical modeling is used with computers to predict weather and to think about 
               how much our climate is likely to heat up in the coming years.

            <li audio="5">
               Mathematical modeling is used to make computer games realistic while, sometimes,
                still 'fantastical'.  How does a building fall when a three story
                monster crashes into it, when you don't know what angle it will be
                viewed from?  How should bullet trajectories and explosions look? 
     
         </li>
    
            <li audio="6">
               Mathematical modeling is used to change or enhance photographic
               images, for instance, making an image have a stained glass look, or 
               making an image look like it was taken one hundred years ago.
