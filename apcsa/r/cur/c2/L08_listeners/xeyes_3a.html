   <p audio="3">
      Now, open up the source code for the <tt>XEyes</tt>
      class, which
      is the main starting point for the program.
   </p>
   <p audio = "4">
      As with many of the classes you have seen in this lesson, <tt>XEyes</tt>
      imports the graphics libraries, implements <tt>MouseListener</tt>, extends a <tt>JPanel</tt>, 
      and has a <tt>JFrame</tt>
      stored in an instance object. 
      Objects from this class, then, represent the program's window and 
      the area where the graphics are drawn.
   </p>
   <p audio="5">
      We know that it will have a <tt>paintComponent</tt>
      method, a constructor, and implement all the contracted <tt>MouseListener</tt> methods. 
   </p>
   <p audio="6">   
      To handle the mouse input, the <tt>XEyes</tt>
      class implements <tt>mouseListener</tt>, meaning it will 
      necessarily have the five mouse handling methods. 
      Based on what you found out from playing with 
      the program, you can assume that the <tt>mouseClicked</tt>
      method will figure out what the
      new position of the pupil is.
  </p>
  <p audio="7"> 
      The constructor calls a <span class="vocab">helper method</span>
      to do more work to get an image based 
      on the string <tt>fileName</tt>.  (The class <tt>File</tt>
      is 
      imported from <tt>java.io.*</tt>). 
   </p>
   <p audio = "8" class="quoteBrown">
      The image comes from a file 
      inside the <i>images</i>
      directory in your <span class="vocab">BlueJ project</span>.  Later, you
      can use your own images or ones you find, if you put them
      in that directory.
   </p>
   <p audio="9">
      Note also that the <tt>XEyes</tt>
      class has two instance variables 
      of the class <tt>Eye</tt>.  These <tt>Eye</tt>
      objects are constructed with 
      arguments very similar to <tt>drawRect</tt>, specifying an origin and a 
      size.
   </p>
   <p audio="10">
      The <tt>paintComponent</tt>
      method first draws the image, and the asks
      the eyes to draw themselves.
