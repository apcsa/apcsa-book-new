      <p audio="2">The <tt>Greetings</tt> constructor starts by 
         instantiating a new <tt>JFrame</tt> as the instance variable <tt>easel</tt>. </p>
      <pre class="width80">
public Greetings() {
   JFrame easel = new JFrame();		
   easel.setSize (myWindowWidth, myWindowHeight);
   easel.setDefaultCloseOperation (JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
   easel.add (this);
   easel.setVisible (true);
}
</pre>
      <p audio="3">Remember, the <tt>JFrame</tt> is the window, or easel, that will hold 
         our canvas (the <tt>Greetings</tt> class, acting like a <tt>JPanel</tt>). 
         Once we have the <tt>JFrame</tt> object, we need to 
         set its size.  The <tt>setSize</tt> method to say how big a canvas we can 
         support. 
         </p>
         <p>In the <tt>setDefaultCloseOperation</tt> call, we say what happens
         when we click on the "close" box of the window being prepared.
         </p>
      <p audio="4">Next, we then connect the <tt>Greetings</tt> object (acting like a <tt>JPanel</tt> object)
         with the <tt>JFrame</tt> object.  We put the canvas onto 
         the easel. 
         The  
         keyword <tt>this</tt> refers to the <tt>Greetings</tt> object currently
         being constructed.</p>
      <p audio="5">Finally, we make the frame and its panel show up on the screen by
      calling the <tt>setVisible</tt> method.</p>
      <p class="quoteBrown" audio="6">So, we've just seen four methods in the <tt>JFrame</tt> class: 
      </p>
         <ol audio="7">
            <li>
               <tt>setSize</tt>, which takes two <tt>int</tt> values as arguments;
            </li>
            <li>
               <tt>setDefaultCloseOperation</tt>, which takes one argument (whose type we'll out later);
            </li>
            <li>
               <tt>add</tt>, which takes a <tt>JPanel</tt>; and
            </li>
            <li>
               <tt>setVisible</tt>, which takes a boolean.
            </li>
         </ol>
         <p class="quoteBrown" audio="8">
         Because the <tt>JFrame</tt> class is already written for you, 
         you can use its methods just like any class in your program.  
         While the <tt>JFrame</tt> class has many, many methods, these are 
         some of the important ones. 
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We'll look later at how to find out about what methods are inside
         of the Java libraries.
