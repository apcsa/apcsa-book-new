      Umm.  When I set the station on my alarm clock, isn't that
      kind of like a callback method?  The radio doesn't play that
      station until the alarm goes off.

      I can tell myself what to dream.  Really!  Before I go to sleep,
      I decide what I should dream about.  And, then my dreaming mind
      just uses that idea later in the night.  That is sort of a callback, no?
