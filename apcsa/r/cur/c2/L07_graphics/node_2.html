         libraries: <tt>java.awt</tt> (short for Abstract Windowing

      	<pre class="width30">import javax.swing.*;</pre>
      
      	<p audio="5">which gives you access to all the classes in the 
      <tt>javax.swing</tt> library.  The <tt>*</tt> (an asterisk) 
      tells the compiler to provide access to <i>every</i> class in the library.
      You could, instead of using an asterisk, name the classes 
      individually with multiple <tt>import</tt> statements.</p>
