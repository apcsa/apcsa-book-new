      <title>The canvas, or drawing area</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="2">The canvas that you draw on is a lot like 
         graphs used in Algebra classes.  The drawing area is made up  
         of a bunch of cells, and a cell is refered to by a <i>x</i> (horizontal) and <i>y</i> (vertical) coordinates.</p>
      <p audio="3" class="quoteOrange">These cells are commonly referred to as 
      <span class="vocab" term="pixel">pixels</span> (short for "picture elements"). </p>
      <p audio="4">In Java, coordinates are two <tt>ints</tt>; the first is the 
         column number (the <i>x</i>, width, or horizontal coordinate), the second is the 
         row (the <i>y</i>, height, or vertical coordinate). 
         Unlike typical mathematical graphs, however, the <i>upper left</i> corner is 
         pointed to by coordinate <tt>0,0</tt>.  As coordinates get bigger, the
         cells they point to are found <i>down</i> and to the right.  Thus, x = 200
         and y = 300 would refer to the point that is 200 pixels to the right of 
         the upper left corner of the frame and 300 pixels down from the upper 
         left corner of the frame.</p>
         
         <!-- NEED DIAGRAM HERE...  A grid with axes on the top and left,
         a 0 at each cell at the upper left (note, number should be *between*
         the grid lines, not on them) and maybe some more numbers.  
         Then, an arrow pointing to 
         cell 3,5 say (with a label of "cell 3,5").  3 is the x, 5 is the y.-->
      
      <p audio="5">Other differences from mathematical graphics are that 
         there are no negative coordinates, and the drawing areas  
         don't go on forever.  Rather, you have 
         to provide a height and a width with the <tt>setSize</tt> method on the 
         containing <tt>JFrame</tt> object. 
         In our program, the window is initially 400 pixels high and  
         300 pixels wide. </p>
      <pre class="width80">public class Greetings extends JPanel {
	
   private int myWindowWidth = 300;
   private int myWindowHeight = 400;
	
   public Greetings() {
      JFrame easel = new JFrame();		
      easel.setSize (myWindowWidth, myWindowHeight);
      ...
