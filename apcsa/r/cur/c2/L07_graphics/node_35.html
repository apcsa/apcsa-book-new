Activities in this lesson introduced the process of setting up a window
and drawing in it.
A "window" in Java consists of two objects: a <tt>JPanel</tt>, 
on which drawing is done, and a <tt>JFrame</tt>,
which acts something like an easel holding the <tt>JPanel</tt>. 
The easel/drawing relationship is illustrated below.
</p>
<img src="/apcsa/r/static/art/graphics/JFrame_vs_JPanel.png">
<p>
The <tt>JPanel</tt> and <tt>JFrame</tt> classes are supplied in
<span class="vocab">class libraries</span> that are distributed
with all Java programming environments.
The libraries have names; a library class is accessed
by giving the <tt>import</tt> keyword followed by the name
of the desired library.
Here, we need to import two libraries:
</p>
<pre>
   import java.awt.*;
   import javax.swing.*;
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>import</tt> statement must appear at the <i>top</i> of a program.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>import</tt> statement allows us to <i>access</i> a class.
In contrast, the <tt>extend</tt> keyword lets us <i>use</i> the class,
typically by supplying some methods of our own that augment or modify
those of the extended class. 
(This technique is called <span class="vocab">inheritance</span>
and is covered in (much) more depth starting in lesson 16.)
The code we worked with in this lesson all involved providing a class
that extends the <tt>JPanel</tt> class:
</p>
<pre>
   public class Greetings extends JPanel {
</pre>
<p>
Setting up the connections between <tt>JPanel</tt> and <tt>JFrame</tt>
is somewhat complicated, but is pretty much consistent from program
to program. We start by constructing a <tt>JFrame</tt>,
then call some of its methods to
</p>
<ul>
<li>
supply its width and height dimensions, 
</li>
<li>
specify what to do when the "close" box is clicked,
</li>
<li>
<i>add</i> the <tt>JPanel</tt> to the <tt>JFrame</tt>, and
</li>
<li>
and display the window on the screen.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here's the code:
</p>
<pre>
   JFrame easel = new JFrame();		
   easel.setSize (myWindowWidth, myWindowHeight);
   easel.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
   easel.add (this);
   easel.setVisible (true);
</pre>
<p>
Finally, we got to do some drawing.
This is done in the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method.
The <tt>paintComponent</tt> is an example of
a <span class="vocab">callback</span> method.
It's not called directly in our code;
instead, it is called by the Java system when some action requires
the window to be redrawn.
<tt>paintComponent</tt> has a single argument, a <tt>Graphics</tt> object
whose methods include facilities for drawing lines, text, and shapes.
</p>
<p>
Relevant <tt>Graphics</tt> methods are <tt>drawString</tt>, <tt>drawLine</tt>,
<tt>drawRect</tt>,
<tt>fillRect</tt>, <tt>drawOval</tt>, and <tt>fillOval</tt>.
All take coordinates for a position in the drawing window as arguments.
Coordinates are all nonnegative&mdash;the upper-left corner of the window
has coordinates (0,0)&mdash;and increase as we move down or to the right.
(Refer to the Java online documentation for further details of how these work,
and for other methods of the <tt>Graphics</tt> class.)
