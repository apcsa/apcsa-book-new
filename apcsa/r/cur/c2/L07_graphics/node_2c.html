	<p audio="1">The <tt>import</tt> statement gives us <i>access</i> to classes in a library. The <span class="vocab"
		term="extends"><tt>extends</tt></span> keyword is one way to <i>use</i> those classes.</p>
	<p audio="2">By saying that one 
         class <i>extends</i> another, we mean that an object of the 
         second class will act <i>just like</i> an object of the first
         class except for a few "extensions".   Generally, these 
         extensions are additional or redefined 
         methods.   Consider the beginning of the <tt>Greetings</tt> class from earlier:</p>
      <pre class="width60">
public class Greetings extends JPanel { </pre>
      <p audio="3">This code is saying that objects from our <tt>Greetings</tt> class  will 
         act just like <tt>JPanel</tt> objects&mdash;in particular, we can draw on 
         them&mdash;with some minor differences. </p>
      <p audio="4" class="quoteBlue">This technique is 
         called <span class="vocab">inheritance</span>, and you don't need
         to understand it fully now.  We'll get a
         lot more practice with it later in the course.</p>
