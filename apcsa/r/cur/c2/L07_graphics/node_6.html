 Look at the pixels on your computer screen.
 How many pixels across are displayed on it?
 Explain how you determined that number.

       I think about 50.  It is hard to tell.  What I did is I opened
       notepad and typed some periods, but then I saw when I put 
       the cursor over the period that each was actually two pixels wide.
       I guess my cursor is one pixel wide!  Anyway, I moved the cursor
       just a little bit until it shifted over, and that was one pixel.
       There were 7 pixels between each period, and about 7 periods
       in an inch of the screen.  Yeah!

       Unlike Mario's crazy way, I measured the width of my screen,
       and then looked up what resolution it was.  My screen 
       resolution is 1280 dots wide, and it is like 20 inches across. 
        Then I used a calculator because I can't 
       divide in my head.  1280/20 is 64, so 64 pixels per inch.

        <div name="Sherry">I used a ruler to measure the size of the 300-by-400 pixel window. It's around 100 pixels per inch.
