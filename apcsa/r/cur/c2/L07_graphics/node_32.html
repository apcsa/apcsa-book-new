<p audio="2"><span class="vocab" term="turtle graphics">Turtle
graphics</span> is an easy way of graphics programming, popularized in the
programming language "Logo". There are many different kinds of turtle
graphics, but there are some basic features always present. A
programmer gives commands to a 'turtle' that then walks around the
drawing canvas. A command such as <i>walk</i> might move the turtle
forward. The turtle carries a pen that can be down or up, which, when
down, will leave a trace of where the turtle has walked. Using turtle
graphics, some relatively complicated pictures can be drawn with
relatively simple programs.</p>
<p audio="2b">In this exercise, you will create a <tt>Turtle</tt>
class that can be used to do some simple turtle graphics.</p>
<div audio="3">
<p>Your <tt>Turtle</tt> class should have four instance variables:
<ul>
	<li>the first representing the direction in which the turtle is
	facing ("up", "right", "left", or "down")</li>
	<li>the second representing the state of the pen (up or down)</li>
	<li>and the final two keeping track of the coordinates of the
	pixel that the turtle is currently on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose some reasonable starting values for these variables.</p>
</div>
<p audio="3b">It should have five methods, all taking no
arguments:</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="4"><tt>lowerPen</tt> and <tt>raisePen</tt>, which
	lower and raise the pen, respectively;</li>
	<li audio="5"><tt>takeStep</tt>, which moves the turtle 20
	pixels in the direction it is headed, drawing a line or not according
	to whether the pen is down or up.</li>
	<li audio="6"><tt>turnRight</tt>, which changes the direction of
	the turtle according to the following table:
	<table id="tableBlue">
		<tr>
			<td><i>before the call to <tt>turnRight</tt></i></td>
			<td><i>after the call</i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>up</td>
			<td>right</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>right</td>
			<td>down</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>down</td>
			<td>left</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>left</td>
			<td>up</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</li>
	<li audio="7">A <tt>turnLeft</tt> method, logically opposite to
	the <tt>turnRight</tt> method above.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="10">Test your program by making another class called <tt>Drawing1</tt>.
In this class, make a <tt>Turtle</tt> object and give it some
commands.</p>
