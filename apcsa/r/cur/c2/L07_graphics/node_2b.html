      <p audio="1">Java comes with thousands and thousands of 
         pre-written classes.  Learning to use these classes is a big part
         of learning to program in Java.</p>
      <p audio="2">The two libraries imported in the greeting program are: </p>
      <pre class="width30">
import java.awt.*;
import javax.swing.*;
</pre>
      <p audio="3">Among the classes supplied in those two 
         libraries are the <tt>JFrame</tt> and <tt>JPanel</tt> classes.  When doing 
         Java graphics, these are two very common and useful classes. </p>

      <div class="talkBubble" char="raster2" color="brown">
         <p audio="4.m1">The relation of <tt>JFrame</tt>
         to <tt>JPanel</tt>
         is similar to that of an easel to a canvas. All the 
         drawing is done on the <tt>JPanel</tt>
         object (the canvas), 
         and the <tt>JFrame</tt>
         (the easel) acts as the window that holds the <tt>JPanel</tt>.</p>
