      <title>Drawing in the paintComponent method</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p audio="2">Let's look at the whole class again, focusing more 
         closely at the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method: </p>
      <pre class="width70">public class Greetings extends JPanel {
   private int myWindowWidth = 300;
   private int myWindowHeight = 400;
	
   public Greetings() {
      JFrame easel = new JFrame();		
      easel.setSize (myWindowWidth, myWindowHeight);
      easel.setDefaultCloseOperation (JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
      easel.add (this);
      easel.setVisible (true);
   }
	
   public void paintComponent (Graphics g) {
      g.drawString ("Hi there!", 150, 200);	
   }
}</pre>
      <p audio="3">The <tt>paintComponent</tt> method is what does the 
         actual drawing.  The <tt>drawString</tt> method will draw a 
         string on a <tt>JPanel</tt> (the canvas).  But we are getting 
         ahead of ourself:  where in this class is the <tt>paintComponent</tt> method
         ever getting called?</p>
      <p class="quoteBlue" audio="3b">Look closely.  You'll notice that nothing in 
         the <tt>Greetings</tt> class calls <tt>paintComponent</tt>. 
         As you might have guessed, the <tt>JPanel</tt> class, 
         which the <tt>Greetings</tt> class is acting like, is doing something sneaky.</p>
      <p audio="3c">It is called whenever the
         underlying system&mdash;that is, Java&mdash;thinks the drawing window needs to be
         updated, for example, immediately after the call to <tt>setVisible</tt>, 
         or after the window is resized, or after
         an overlapping window is moved or deleted.  (We saw a similar situation in lesson 1, where the "tick" method in the alarm clock was called by some clock internal process.)
</p><p>
If the <tt>JFrame</tt> was 
         never made visible, or if the <tt>Greetings</tt> object was never attached
         to the <tt>JFrame</tt>, then <tt>paintComponent</tt> would never be called.</p>
