        <p audio="2">Some students are confused by having a method in their class that apparently no one calls. 
            Such a method is called a <span class="vocab">callback method</span>. 
            It's not such a weird concept&mdash;some methods in the <tt>Refillable</tt> and <tt>Name</tt> classes weren't called in the classes themselves, but by a user.</p>
        <p audio="3">There are also real-life analogs to callbacks, for instance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li audio="4">A cell phone owner might set up a method that translates a phone number into a ring tone. The user never calls that method, but the phone's operating system does when an incoming call is noticed.</li>
            <li audio="5">One might set up a method in an email program that detects spam, or highlights messages likely to be of interest.  The user doesn't call this method.
                The mail system does when it detects the arrival of email.</li>
        </ul>
