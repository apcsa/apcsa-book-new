      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p audio="2">
         The game of Hangman is played by two people, a "chooser" and a "guesser".
         The chooser thinks of a word, and write a row of dashes, one per character in the word:
      </p>
      <pre>
   _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</pre>
      <p audio="3">
         The guesser tries to guess the word by asking if it contains a particular character:
      </p>
      <div class="quoteBlue"  audio="4">
         "Does it have an R?"
      </div>
      <p  audio="5">
         If the guesser asked about a letter contained in the word,
         the chooser writes it in the corresponding positions in the row of dashes:
      </p>
      <pre>
   R _ _ _ _ R _
</pre>
      <p  audio="6">
         The guesser wins by guessing all the characters in the word with fewer than a predetermined number of wrong guesses.
      </p>
      <p>
         The game is called "Hangman" because the chooser draws a portion of a diagram of a hanging person at each incorrect guess made by the guesser.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
         Code and test a version of the Hangman game. 
         Your solution will involve a <tt>Hangman</tt> class
         whose constructor chooses a word, and whose <tt>guess</tt>
         method processes each guessed character.
