A student observes that a test date in December causes <tt>myMonthNumber</tt> 

to take on all values between 1 and 12, and therefore results in all cases 

of the <tt>if ... else</tt> being executed. 

Describe a small change to the code that would not affect the behavior 

for a date in December but would introduce a bug for some other case.
