        <title>A Different Number Guesser</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="2">
Test the following implementation of the number guesser, which has the computer doing the guessing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The constructor for the <tt>Guesser</tt> class has an <tt>int</tt> parameter that defines the range of integers to guess.  It then draws three "buttons" on which to specify that the guess made by the computer is too big, too small, or the number to be guessed. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The computer's guess is displayed in the first call to <tt>printComponent</tt>.  From then on, the computer will determine its next guess based on response by the user.
The <tt>mouseClicked</tt> method indicates whether the guess is too small, too large, or a correct guess, and produces the next guess based on the position of the click.
