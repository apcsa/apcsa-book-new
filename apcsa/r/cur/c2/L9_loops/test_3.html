All the test principles discussed so far focused on testing features of the code. 
Since they assume that we can see into the program, these techniques are collectively referred
to as <span class="vocab">glass-box testing</span>. 
</p>
<p audio="3">
Another testing approach is called <span class="vocab">black-box testing</span>. 
It involves generating test cases based only on the problem specification, 
not on the code itself. There are several big advantages of this approach:
</p>
<ul>
	<li audio="4">The test generation is not biased by knowledge of the code. 
	    For instance, a program author might mistakenly conclude 
	    that a given situation is logically impossible 
	    and fail to include tests for that situation; 
	    a black-box tester would be less likely to fall into this trap.</li>
	<li audio="5">Since black-box tests are generated from the problem specification, 
	    they can be used without change when the program implementation is modified.</li>
	<li audio="6">The results of a black-box test should make sense to someone unfamiliar with the code.</li>
	<li audio="7">Black-box tests can be easily designed before the program is written.</li>
</ul>
