When execution reaches the statement at which you set the breakpoint, it will stop,
displaying an arrow on the stop sign you set and showing you the debugger window.

The debugger window presents you with a lot of information that's not very useful
here.  However, it also tells you values of instance variables (in the pane titled
"Instance variables"), which will be quite helpful.

The five large buttons at the bottom of the window let us control the program
once it has been suspended.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>Step</tt> executes the next statement or evaluates the next condition in the program. If the statement is a method call, it calls the method, then stops once the method returns.</li>
	<li><tt>Step Into</tt> does what <tt>Step</tt> does, except if the next statement is a method call, it stops the program at the first statement in the method.</li>
	<li><tt>Continue</tt> resumes the program.</li>
	<li><tt>Terminate</tt> kills the program.</li>
</ul>
<p audio="5">
The screen shot below shows the result of hitting <tt>Continue</tt>.
