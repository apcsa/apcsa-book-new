         To print the line "I like Java!" eighty times on the console, 
         we use a variable named <tt>count</tt>
         (any reasonably descriptive name is fine)
         whose value says how many lines we've printed so far. 
         Thus <tt>count</tt>
         plays the role of a <span class="vocab">counter variable</span> 
         or a "stepper" variable. 
         The initial value of the <tt>int</tt> <tt>count</tt>
         should be 0, indicating that we haven't printed anything yet.
      </p>
      <pre class="width60">
   count = 0;
</pre>
      <p audio="3">
         The <span class="vocab">loop body</span> contains the <tt>println</tt>
         statement 
         as well as an <span class="vocab">assignment statement</span> 
         that increments <tt>count</tt>.
      </p>
      <pre class="width60">
   count = count + 1;         
   System.out.println ("I like Java!");  
</pre>
      <p audio="4">
         Finally, we supply the <span class="vocab">boolean expression</span>.  
         We want to continue the loop
         while we haven't yet printed eighty lines.
         Alternatively, we want to terminate the loop 
         once we've printed the eightieth line.
         A boolean expression that represents our desires is
      </p>
      <pre class="width60">
   while (count &lt; 80)
</pre>
      <p audio="5">
         Putting it all together, we have
      </p>
      <pre class="width70">
   count = 0;
   while (count &lt; 80) {
      count = count + 1;
      System.out.println ("I like Java!");
   }
</pre>
      <p audio="6">
         Quite an exchange&mdash;we need only five lines to do the work of eighty!
