You may know of the song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". It goes like this:
</p>

<div class="quoteBrown" audio="3"><i>
99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.<br />
If one of those bottles should happen to fall, 98 bottles of beer on the wall. <br /><br />
98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.<br />
If one of those bottles should happen to fall, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.</i>
</div>
<div class="imageCenter">

Using only the Java we've seen so far, we would find it
quite tedious to write a program to print those lyrics&mdash;we'd have to make many calls to <tt>System.out.println</tt>!
To make the computer do something repetitively,
we would call a method over and over by hand using BlueJ's Object Bench.  Or in the case of an event handler like <tt>mouseClicked</tt> 
we would need to click the mouse multiple times to get a picture painted over and over.
Upcoming activities introduce the technique of <span class="vocab">looping</span>,
enabling us to encode repetitive actions.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li audio="6">animation, repeating images that change slightly at each repetition to give the illusion of movement;</li>
<li audio="7">search for particular characters in a string; and</li>
<li audio="8">printing the complete lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" with much less tedium.</li>

</ul>
