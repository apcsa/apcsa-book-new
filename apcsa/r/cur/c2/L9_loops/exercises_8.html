and determines the corresponding month number (a number between 1 and 12, 
stored in <tt>myMonthNumber</tt>)
and day in that month (stored in <tt>myDateInMonth</tt>).
For example, the argument 30 should set <tt>myMonthNumber</tt> to 1
and <tt>myDateInMonth</tt> to 30, and the argument 32 should set <tt>myMonthNumber</tt> to 2
and <tt>myDateInMonth</tt> to 1.
