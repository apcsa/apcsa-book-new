Here is the solution framework for the <tt>DateConverter</tt> constructor in an earlier exercise.

A student observes that a test date in December causes <tt>myMonthNumber</tt> 
to take on all values between 1 and 12, and therefore results in all cases 
of the <tt>if ... else</tt> being executed. 
Describe a small change to the code that would not affect the behavior 
for a date in December but would introduce a bug for some other case.
