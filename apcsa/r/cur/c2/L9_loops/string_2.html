<title>Determining the length of a string</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="2">On to design of the <tt>length</tt> method. We start
with a counter as in the "I like Java!" printer. It initially gets
value 0, indicating that we haven't yet processed any characters in
the string.</p>
<pre class="width40">
private int length (String s) {
   int charCount;
   charCount = 0;
   while ( ... ) {
      ...
   }
}
</pre>
<p audio="3">Inside the <tt>while</tt> loop, we must do two
things. One is to increment <tt>charCount</tt> to acknowledge that
we've seen another character in the string. The second is to remove
that character from the string to avoid counting it twice or more.</p>
<pre class="width70">
   while ( ... ) {
      charCount = charCount + 1;
      s = s.substring (1); 
      // new s has everything but the first character of old s
   }
</pre>
<p audio="4">The <tt>while</tt> condition must then ensure that
there is at least one more character in the string to tally in the
length:</p>
<pre class="width70">
   while (!s.equals("")) {
      charCount = charCount + 1;
      s = s.substring (1); 
      // new s has everything but the first character of old s
   }
</pre>
