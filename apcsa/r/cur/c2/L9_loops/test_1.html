A <tt>while</tt> loop may execute 0 times if its condition
is not satisfied the first time it's evaluated.
Such loops are common, for example, when empty strings are involved.
A programmer must make certain that appropriate initializations have been made in such cases, 
and also to verify correct behavior by testing the code on inputs that result
in loops whose bodies are not executed.
</p>
<p audio="3">
We of course need tests of more typical cases, e.g. loops that execute once
and loops that execute more than once.
If there is a maximum number of iterations of the loop, we should test that too.
Finally, we also make certain to include among our tests all possible ways 
to terminate the loop.
</p>
<p audio="4">
Keep in mind that successful tests don't necessarily mean that the tested code
is correct.  Tests only reveal the existence of bugs, not the absence of bugs.
