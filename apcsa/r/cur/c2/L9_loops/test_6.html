Consider the problem of determining the number of <i>runs</i> in a string.
A run is a consecutive sequence of identical characters that's as long as possible.
A run may be just one character long.  For example, the string "xyyzxxxxmnn" contains 6 runs.

Devise a set of test strings with which to test a run-counting method.
