In black-box testing as in glass-box testing, 
we try to test all possibilities of the specification. 
These include typical as well as boundary cases, 
which represent situations that are extreme in some way, 
e.g. where a value is as large or as small as possible. 
There are often a variety of features whose "boundaries" should be considered. 
For example, in the <tt>DateConverter</tt> program, 
boundary cases would include not only dates in the first and last months of the year, 
but also the first and last dates of each month.
