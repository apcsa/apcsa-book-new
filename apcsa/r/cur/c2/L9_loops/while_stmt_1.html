        <title>The while statement</title>

Suppose we want to print the line "I like Java!" eighty times on the console.
Doing it once is easy:
</p>
<pre class="width60">
System.out.println ("I like Java!");
</pre>
<p audio="3">
Doing it eighty times is woefully slow and inefficient.
</p>
<p audio="4">
A better way to do this in Java is with a <span class="vocab" term="while"><tt>while</tt></span>  statement.
A <tt>while</tt> statement has three parts:
</p>
<ol>
	<li audio="5">the keyword <tt>while</tt>;</li>
	<li audio="6">a boolean expression enclosed in parentheses; and</li>
	<li audio="7">a program segment to be repeated, referred to as the <span class="vocab" term="loop body">body</span>
	of the <tt>while</tt> statement.</li>
</ol>
<p audio="8">
A <tt>while</tt> loop is executed as follows. </p>
<ol>
	<li audio="9">First, the boolean expression is evaluated. 
	    If it's false, the repetition stops, 
	    and execution continues with the statement following the <tt>while</tt> loop body.</li>
	<li audio="10">If the expression is true, the <i>entire body</i> is executed.</li>
	<li audio="11">Then the boolean expression is evaluated again, 
	    and the <tt>while</tt> statement terminates or continues as just described.</li>
</ol>
<p audio="12">
One way to diagram this process is shown below in a <span class="vocab">flow chart</span>, as shown below.
Arrows specify the <i>flow</i> of the program, namely the execution sequence.
A <tt>while</tt> statement is often referred to as a <span class="vocab">loop</span>.
The arrow from the bottom of the body to the boolean expression closes the loop.
