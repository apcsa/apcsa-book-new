Write a method named <tt>nextLeapYear</tt>
that, given an integer <tt>year</tt>, returns the first leap year
that's greater than <tt>year</tt>.

Leap years are commonly thought to occur every 4 years, but there are some exceptions to this rule. 
If a year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year. If it is divisible by 100, it is <strong>not</strong>
a leap year. Otherwise, if it is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year. Here are some examples:

<table id="tableBlue">
<tr><td>Year</td><td>Leap year?</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1800</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1900</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1904</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1905</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2000</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
