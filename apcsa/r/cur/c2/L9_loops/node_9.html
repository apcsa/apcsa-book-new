        <div name="joe">I read the code carefully. It crashes when the string ends in a blank.

        <div name="sherry">The code doesn't work when there are more than one consecutive blank.  For example, "  a" starts with pos = 0, then turns the string into " a", then it sets pos to 1, which is the position of the "a".
I found it by trying the case that has a "typical" (more than 1) consecutive blanks.
