Now consider a guessing game.
You pick an integer between 1 and 15,
and the computer tries to guess it with the minimum number of guesses.
You answer each of the computer's guesses by indicating "too high", "too low", or "you got it".
</p>
<br /><br /><br />

<p audio="3">
The computer's procedure for minimizing the number of guesses is as follows.
It keeps track of the range of integers in which your number might be;
for example, when the game starts, it knows only that your number is between 1 and 15.
It then guesses the <i>middle</i> of that range&mdash;here, 8.
If you say that 8 is too big, it can rule out half the range;
the number now most be between 1 and 7.  
Again the computer guesses the middle of the range&mdash;4.
If this time you say "too small", it rules out values between 1 and 4,
knowing now that your number is between 5 and 7.
And so on.

This technique is called <span class="vocab">binary search</span>.
We'll revisit it later in the course.
