This lesson introduced the <span class="vocab"><tt>while</tt> loop</span>, a mechanism for repeating the execution of a given sequence of statements.
A <tt>while</tt> loop has two parts: the <i>test</i> (a boolean expression), and the <i>loop body</i> (a sequence of statements).
It is executed by first evaluating the test.  If the result is false, the loop terminates; execution continues with the statement following the loop body.
If the result is true, it executes all the statements in the body, then checks the test again. If that result is false, the loop terminates.
Otherwise it executes all the statements in the body again, then checks the test again, and so on.
</p>

Loops introduce a significant level of complexity to programming.
In particular, it is easy to have bugs in a loop that are difficult to find.
Thorough testing is a good idea, using test data that exercise "typical" behavior as well as <i>boundary</i> cases&mdash;data for which the loop should execute 0 times, the minimum number of times, and the maximum number of times.  It is often a good strategy to design the tests before the code!

Any reasonable programming environment comes with a <span class="vocab">debugger</span> that lets you monitor the progress of a program. Debuggers let you do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set breakpoints, places in the program where the debugger will stop.</li>
<li>Single-step the program by executing the next statement and then stopping the program again.</li>
<li>Examine variable values.</li>
</ul>
