<p audio="2">
For <tt>java.util.Random</tt>, <tt>a</tt> was chosen to be a large value.
Also, instead of the rightmost digits, the value returned is chosen
from digit positions further left in the product.
More details are provided in the online Java documentation.

The computation also takes advantage of another quirk of Java arithmetic.
The number of different values that can be stored in an <tt>int</tt> is limited;
the maximum allowable int value is <tt>2<sup>31</sup>-1</tt>.
One might expect some sort of error to result from trying to compute a value that's too big.
(This is called <span class="vocab">overflow</span>.)
When we compute a sum or a product that's greater than <tt>2<sup>31</sup>-1</tt>,
however, <i>no error is signalled</i>.
This lets some unintended arithmetic errors go undetected,
but simplifies the coding of classes like <tt>Random</tt>.
