<p>
This lesson introduced a <span class="vocab">(pseudo) random number generator</span>, a class named <tt>Random</tt> in the <tt>java.util</tt> library.
An initialized <tt>Random</tt> object has a method named <tt>nextInt</tt> that, given a positive integer argument <tt>n</tt>,
returns an integer between 0 and <tt>n-1</tt>.
Moreover, the sequence of values returned by <tt>nextInt</tt> looks like each value was randomly chosen.
</p>
<p>
A random number generator can be used to model real-world actions.
For instance, repeated calls to <tt>nextInt (2)</tt> model repeated flips of a coin, and repeated calls to <tt>nextInt (6)</tt> simulate the throwing of a six-sided die.
Exercises include a random number generator to simulate the "dot racing" game often seen at sports events and the casino game of Craps.
