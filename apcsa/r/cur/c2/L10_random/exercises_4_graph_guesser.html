<title>Guessing distributions from graphs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="1">Let's look back at the bar chart you used to show the
results from a single die roll, or distributions will six different
values. In the <tt>GraphGuesser</tt> project there is a bar chart
class that can show distributions resulting from two six-side dice
rolls, with twelve different values. We'll show you some graphs made
from (relatively) simple java expressions involving random numbers;
your job is to write an expression&mdash;we'll call it a
generator&mdash;that makes a graph pretty similar to the one shown.
The graphs were made with 12,000 trials, although you can get the same
shape with a different count, of course.</p>

<p class="quoteBrown" audio="1b">An aside: the <tt>BarChart12</tt>
class will become <i>much</i> easier to write when you learn about <span
   class="vocab" term="collection_class">collections</span>, starting
in lesson 12. If you look at the source code for the <tt>BarChart12</tt>
class, you will see thirteen separate instance variables and long,
albeit regular conditionals. Imagine writing a bar chart that could
show distributions with 100 different values! Collections will make
this much, much easier, and even make possible things that are
impossible now (for instance, bar charts for any number of values).</p>

   <li>You've seen this code before: it involves multiple
   six-sided dice rolls. <br />
   <br />

   <li>There are no conditionals in this generator. <br />
   <br />

   <li>This one is kind of hard. Do it without conditionals, if
   you can: you'll want to use <tt>Math.sqrt()</tt>, which takes an
   number (an integer is fine) and returns the square root of that
   number as a <tt>double</tt>. Remember, you'll then need to convert
   the <tt>double</tt> into an <tt>int</tt>. <br />
   <br />

   <li>This graph is a close approximation of standard bell
   shaped curve, or <i>normal distribution</i>. It is, actually, a <i>binomial
   distribution.</i>
      <br />
   <br />
   A hint: think about these two generators, and how the shapes
   they make are getting closer to the normal distribution:<br />
   <br />
   <ul>
      <li>randGen.nextInt(12)</li>
      <li>randGen.nextInt(6) + randGen.nextInt(6)</li>
   </ul>
   <br />
   <br />
   What would be the logical extension of this pattern? <br />
