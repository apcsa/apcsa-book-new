         To make things exciting, you should make it so that one dot can 
         surge ahead of the others.  This isn't likely to happen with 
         many trials from a uniform random  number
         generator.  (Try it, though).
         <br>
         <br>
         Instead, you should, once in a while, move the dot multiple
         pixels, and very occasionally, move the dot ahead a lot.  Play with
         this to find the most interesting effect.

         Some people at ball games swear that certain 
         dots win more often than others. Make it so!  Look at the <tt>Dot</tt>
         class 
         and figure out how to make a dot that can cheat.  (Don't do it in  
         the <tt>DotRacer</tt>
         methods, where other dots might be looking ...). 
         <br>
         <br>
         You might need to make 
         another class like <tt>Dot</tt>, say, called <tt>CheaterDot</tt>, that 
         has the same methods as <tt>Dot</tt>
         (albeit with a sneaky change
         or two to a method body).  Be subtle, however (i.e., use randomness).
