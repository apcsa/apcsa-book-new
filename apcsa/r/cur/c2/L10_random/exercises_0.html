         Dot racing is a popular event at American baseball games.  In 
         between an inning in the game, the scoreboard shows a  
         computer-generated 
         race between different colored dots.  In many venues, people  
         cheer madly for what is, at its heart, a program using a 
         loop and random number generation.

         So that you too can feel the adulation of a stadium full of 
         mostly sane fans, complete the <tt>DotRacing</tt> class below.

         In the program there are three dots, represented by instances of 
         the <tt>Dot</tt>
         class, and stored in instance variables <tt>racer0</tt>, <tt>racer1</tt>, and <tt>racer2</tt>.  On each turn (a cycle 
         through a <tt>while</tt>
         loop, one dot gets to move, and it moves
         forward a integer number of pixels.  The first to reach the finish
         line wins.  You start the race by instantiating an object from the 
         <tt>DotRace</tt> class.

         There are two methods that you need to complete.
      </p>
      <pre class="width80">
   // This method returns the 'Dot' (either racer0, racer1, or racer2)
   // whose turn it is to move.
   private Dot whoMoves() {
   }</pre>
      <pre class="width80">
   //  This method returns the number of pixels that the dot moves
   private int howFar() {
   }
</pre>
