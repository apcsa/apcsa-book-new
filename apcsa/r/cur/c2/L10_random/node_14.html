    <div class="title">A Pair of Dice</div>

    <div class="prompt">
    <p> Consider a method <tt>nextRoll()</tt> that is supposed to return the result of rolling a pair of dice. Since the result is always in the range 2 to 12, one student wrote the following code for the method body:
</br>
<pre>
 <tt>return dice.nextInt(11) + 2;</tt>
</pre>
Another student wrote the following method body:</br>
<pre>
 <tt>return dice.nextInt(6) + dice.nextInt(6) + 2;</tt>
</pre>
When these students tested their methods, it was true that both methods always returned a result in the range 2 through 12, but the percentage of each number varied greatly. The first student found that his code return a 7 about 9% of the time. The second student found that her code returned a 7 about 17% of the time. Why did they get different results? Which method best simulates the rolling of a pair of dice? </p>
