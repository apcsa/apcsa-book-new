The human view of randomness differs somewhat from the statistical view.
(When asked to select a "random" integer between 1 and 4, inclusive, most people will choose 3.)
One of the characteristics of a good generator of random coin flips 
is that every possible pair of flips (HH, HT, TH, and TT) 
should appear equally often in the sequence.
The same hold for possible triples, possible quadruples, etc.
Thus the sequence "tails tails tails" should be just as likely
as the sequence "heads tails tails", even though the latter sequence looks more "random".

What would account for this difference between how humans think of randomness
and the more accurate statistical view?
