Suppose that a sequence of coin flips&mdash;calls to <tt>nextInt</tt> with argument 2&mdash;produces the following values:
</p>
<pre>
 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
</pre>
<p>
Does the sequence of flips look random? Why or why not?
</p>

        <div name="Martinique">They look fairly random, but the numbers seem low to me so maybe they're not truly random?

        <div name="Trisha">They look totally random to me.    Little or no repeats.  A mix of even and odds.  Looks like someday rolled the dice each time to get the values.

        <div name="Sherry">The first five numbers are all the same, and then the next five numbers alternate.
So if you split the sequence in half, there are these patterns.
