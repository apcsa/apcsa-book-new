         Consider the following game, referred to as the St. Petersburg Lottery.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="3">
            I pay a fixed entry fee, and a pot is initialized to $1.
         </li>
         <li audio="4">
            A fair coin is flipped repeatedly. If a head is flipped, the pot doubles. 
            If a tail is flipped, I get the pot and the game ends. 
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p audio="5">
         Thus if a tail is flipped immediately, I get $1; if a head appears and then a tail,
         I get $2; if two head appear and then a tail, I get $4, and so on. 
         The problem is to determine what a fair entry fee would be&mdash;that is, 
         the approximate amount I should pay so that I break even on the average.
      </p>

         Suppose you were running a casino.
         What's your guess as to what you would charge me so that you'd make a profit on the game?
         Briefly explain your guess.
