 Consider the following game, referred to as the St. Petersburg Lottery.
 </p>
 <ol>
 <li audio="3">
 I pay a fixed entry fee, and a pot is initialized to $1.
 </li>
 <li audio="4">
 A fair coin is flipped repeatedly. If a head is flipped, the pot doubles. 
 If a tail is flipped, I get the pot and the game ends. 
 </li>
 </ol>
 <p audio="5">
 Thus if a tail is flipped immediately, I get $1; if a head appears and then a tail,
 I get $2; if two heads appear and then a tail, I get $4, and so on. 
 The problem is to determine what a fair entry fee would be&mdash;that is, 
 the approximate amount I should pay so that I break even on the average.
 </p>
 <p audio="6">
 Suppose you were running a casino.
 What's your guess as to what you would charge me so that you'd make a profit on the game?
 Briefly explain your guess.

        <div name="Sherry">Suppose I pay $4 to play. If the flip is tails, I lose $3. If two flips are heads then tails, I lose $2. If three flips are heads, heads, and tails, then I break even.  So it depends on how often those things happen.

        <div name="Joe">I bet that charging $100 would work. There would have to be a bunch of heads in a row for the player to win.
