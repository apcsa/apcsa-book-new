Here's an example.  Suppose the seed is 4, a is 9, b is 5, and we want a single random digit
at each call (we choose the rightmost digit). </p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>r</td> <td>a * r + b</td> <td>return value</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td> <td>9 * 4 + 5 = 41</td> <td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td> <td>9 * 1 + 5 = 14</td> <td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4</td> <td>9 * 4 + 5 = 41</td> <td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td></td> <td>...</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
This of course is not a very interesting random number generator,
since it only returns two values, alternating between them.
In a real random number generator, 
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are chosen so that the return values look randomly chosen.
