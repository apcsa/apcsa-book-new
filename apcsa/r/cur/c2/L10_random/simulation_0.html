When you use randomly generated numbers in your programs,
a basic problem arises: how do you test your code?  You can't 
know exactly what will happen as the program executes because,
well, it's random!
</p>
<p audio="2b">
One way to verify the correctness of the generator 
is to run it a lot of times, and to judge the results
against what you know should be happening on average.

For instance, the following method uses a loop to test
coin flips (or, more exactly, generation of random integers between
<tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt> inclusively).
</p>
<pre class="width60">
   public void tester (int howMany) {
      int k;
      int numHeads;
      k = 0;
      while (k &lt; howMany) {
         k = k + 1;
         if (nextFlip().equals("heads")) {
            numHeads = numHeads + 1;
         }
      }
      System.out.println ("" + numHeads + " out of "
	     + howMany + " flips were heads.");
   }
