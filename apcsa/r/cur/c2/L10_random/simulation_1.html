         The science of probability got started in the mid-seventeenth century
         in the effort to determine the likely outcomes of gambling games involving dice. 
        
         You can find quite a bit of information on the Internet, but here's 
         a quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quoteOrange" audio="5">
         Chevalier de Me&acute;r&acute;e [a French nobleman]
         gambled frequently to increase his wealth. He bet on a roll of a die
         that at least one 6 would appear during a total of four rolls. From
         past experience, he knew that he was more successful than not with this
         game of chance. Tired of his approach, he decided to change the game.
         He bet that he would get a total of 12, or a double 6, on twenty-four
         rolls of two dice. Soon he realized that his old approach to the game 
         resulted in more money. 
      </blockquote>

         In the following BlueJ project, there is some code for generating pairs of dice rolls. 
         The <tt>DieRollGenerator</tt>
         class contains methods to compute the likelihood
         of rolling one 6 in four rolls, <tt>testSixInFourRolls</tt>, and then a test method to simulate rolling the dice four times and seeing how often you get one 6, <tt>runTestSix</tt>. 
         Run these two methods to discover your chance of rolling a six in four rolls and complete the methods <tt>test12In24Rolls</tt> and <tt>runTestTwelve</tt> to 
         simulate and discover what your chances are of rolling a 12 in twenty-four
         rolls of a pair of dice.
