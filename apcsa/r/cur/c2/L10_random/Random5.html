Suppose you want to model a pair of dice.
You might think of doing the following:
</p>
<pre>
import java.util.Random;

public class PairOfDice {

    private Random d1;
    private Random d2;
    
    public PairOfDice ( ) {
        d1 = new Random ( );
        d2 = new Random ( );
    }
    
    public void roll ( ) {
        System.out.println ("Roll: " + (d1.nextInt(6)+1)
                + " " + (d2.nextInt(6)+1));
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Recall, however, how the values returned by a <tt>Random</tt> object are computed.
In the code above, we've let the Java system choose the seed;
thus <tt>d1</tt>'s seed and <tt>d2</tt>'s seed are the same, 
as are their <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> values.
Calling <tt>roll</tt> thus produces two equal die rolls!
</p>
<p>
The moral: use one Random object throughout a program.
(One way to do this is via a <span class="vocab">static variable</span>
that's "owned" by <i>all</i> the objects in a class.
We'll explore the use of static methods and variables in a few weeks.
