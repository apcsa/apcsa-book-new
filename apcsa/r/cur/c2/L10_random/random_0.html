        The <tt>Random</tt>
         class in the <tt>java.util</tt>
         
         library provides a way
         to produce a sequence of values that appear to be randomly chosen. 
         <tt>Random</tt>
         has two methods of interest right now (and many more that 
         can be useful) :
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="3">
            a zero-argument constructor, and 
         </li>
         <li audio="4">
            a <tt>nextInt</tt>
            method that takes an argument <tt>n</tt>
            and returns an integer between 0 and <tt>n-1</tt>, inclusive.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p audio="5">
         Before you can use the <tt>Random</tt> class to generate a random number you must first instantiate a <tt>Random</tt> object.  For example,<br>
</p>
   <pre>
   Random gen = new Random(); 
   int x = gen.nextInt(5);  // returns a random number from 0 to 4
   </pre>
<p>

         Thus <tt>gen.nextInt(2)</tt>
         could represent a coin flip (where a 0 means one side of a coin, 
         and a 1 means the other side).
Here's a program segment that uses <tt>nextInt</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
private Random coin;
coin = new Random ( );
coinFlip = coin.nextInt(2);
</pre>
<p>
Now consider the expression:</p>
      <pre class="width30">( die.nextInt(6) + 1 )</pre>
      <p audio="6">
         This represents the throw of a six-sided die (one of the numbers 1, 2,
         3, 4, 5, or 6).  Here the <tt>nextInt</tt> method returns a random number from 0 to 5 then 1 is added to this number resulting in a random number from 1 to 6.
      </p>
