         Write a program to play the casino dice game named Craps.
         Here are the rules.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="3">
            The player bets, then rolls a pair of dice.  For this
            simulation, don't worry about the size of the bet.
         </li>
         <li audio="4">
            If the roll is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses the bet. 
         </li>
         <li audio="5">
            If the roll is 7 or 11, the player wins the bet.
         </li>
         <li audio="6">
            Otherwise, the roll becomes the <i>point</i>. 
         </li>
         <li audio="7">
            The player continues to roll until rolling either 7&mdash;for which 
            the player loses&mdash;or rolling the point&mdash;for which the player wins.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p audio="8">
         Simulate the game many, many times and determine how often,
         as a percentage,
          the player is likely to win his or her bet.
