    <!-- A brainstorm generates an unique identifier that it uses to communicate with the server and group responses.  
         You can control the unique identifier in various ways:
           First, an "id" is picked:
               if the id attribute is present and long enough (6 chars), it will be used.  You'll need to remember
                 to change this every time, though!
               if the id attribute is missing (or short), then "title" will be checked.  You can make sure those are unique
                 more easily, perhaps.  If title is long enough, it will be used.
               if title isn't good, then the body of the div is used (not the <div> tags and attributes themselves, though).
           Then, the "id" is concatenated with the course name, and the thing is hashed to generate the unique identifier
         If two brainstorms have the same unique identifier, then comments will spill over!
         -->
