            every so often to tell you something about what you're
            learning. I'm here to help, because we have a lot to do!</p>

            your time in this course actually programming, which is

                alt="key icon" /> warning), but he knows his code.
            You'll be programming circles around him before you know it.

            things you should watch out for -- like particularly tricky
            programming concepts or Twitterton's acerbic sense of humor.</p>
