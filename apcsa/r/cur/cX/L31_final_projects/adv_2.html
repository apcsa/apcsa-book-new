         Here are some more ideas for extending the
         adventure project:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="3a">
            <p>
               An item can be put inside another item, and
               something new is created. Descriptions and usage should
               change, and suceeding in the game should depend on
               these item combinations.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3b">
            <p>
               Items and rooms can have states that change as they
               are interacted with.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3c">
            <p>
               Entry and exit from rooms is barred until particular
               items are possessed, not possessed, used, etc.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3d">
            <p>
               A player needs to "wait" (that is a command) in a
               room before certain things become possible: before an
               item is visible, before an exit is visible, etc.
               Descriptions should change.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3e">
            <p>
               Make a <tt>Character</tt>
               class by extending item.
               Characters are like other players: they hold
               conversations, they can move between rooms by
               themselves, they can take items from the player or drop
               them for the player.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3f">
            <p>
               Items have a certain weight, and a player has a
               maximum load that she can carry.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3g">
            <p>
               Do something interesting with the Player's name.
               (Ask the player for it before the game starts). Rooms
               can call the player by name, etc.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3h">
            <p>
               The could be a point system, and players "win" if
               they get enough points. Points could come by collecting
               "treasure" items, or solving puzzles, etc.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p audio="4">
         Your teacher may have a list of requirements for
         you to complete this project. A good starting point is that
         you make 5-10 "interesting" items and 5-10 "interesting"
         rooms, where interesting is something like the above list.
         And that you make your game fun to play!
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         In your project writeup, you will also need to
         include:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="6a">
            <p>
               A paragraph in the executive summary describing the
               main scenario in your game, and a paragraph summarizing
               your new items and rooms.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="6b">
            <p>
               A section describing each item and room in your
               game. For each, include the class name and a paragraph
               describing your implementation. Don't describe every
               detail of your code; rather, give us a high-level
               overview of what the item/room can do, and rationales
               behind the approach you took to implementing that
               functionality (i.e., why you did it that way).
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="6c">
            <p>
               One or more transcripts of your game being played
               that show all of the things that it can do. A
               transcript is a log of everything that the player sees
               while playing the game. Create these by playing your
               game and then copy-and-pasting the contents of the
               console window into your write-up. You might need
               several transcripts to show all the functionality of
               your items and rooms. For instance, if there are
               several ways that your game can end, you should include
               transcripts for each.
            </p>
