      <h4 audio="1">Background</h4>
      <p audio="2">
         You play the solitaire card game called "Aces
         Up" as follows. Start with a shuffled deck of 52 cards, and
         space on the table for four stacks of cards. Then repeat the
         following process:
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li audio="3a">
            <p>
               Deal the next four cards from the deck to the four
               stacks
            </p>
         </li>
         <li audio="3b">
            <p>
               Make "plays". There are two kinds of plays:
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li audio="3b1">
                  <b>Discard</b>: When the top cards in two stacks are the
                  same suit, the card with lower rank is discarded.
                  (Ace ranks highest, then king and so on down to 2.)
               </li>
               <li audio="3b2">
                  <b>Fill an empty stack</b>: The top card of any nonempty 
                  stack may be moved to an empty stack. This play is optional.
               </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p audio="4">
         The game is won when all 52 cards have been dealt, 
         and only an ace remains in each stack.
          The example below shows the last few plays of a winning game.

         The game seems rather difficult to win. One book, 
         <u>The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games</u>, 
         by A.H. Morehead and G. Mott-Smith, 
         estimates the odds of winning as 1 in 10.

      <h4 audio="7">Problem</h4>
      
      
      <p audio="8">
      Write a program that graphically plays Aces Up.  We have provided framework code (available
      from the next page) that defines <tt>Card</tt> and <tt>Deck</tt> classes.  Each 
      <tt>Card</tt> instance has an associated picture, and a draw method that knows how
      to draw the card.  You are to write the rest of the program, and have it use 
      mouse input to indentify card choices and images to represent what the card
      value and rank, and which stack it is in.
