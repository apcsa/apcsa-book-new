         Details about your tasks for each of the three projects follows in later pages
         in this lesson.  However, there are tasks that the same for any project you
         choose.  These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li audio="3a">
            <b>Project writeup</b>: You will need to create and submit a 
            <i>Project Writeup</i>.  Yes, even programmers need to
            write, and do it well, so that people can understand what 
            they have done.  The exact contents of this writeup depend on the
            particular project, but all will have:
            <ol>
               <li>Executive summary: A one to three paragraph summary of your work</li>
               <li>Transcripts and/or screenshots of the program being run. This
               section should give the reader a feel of a typical user's full session, from
               beginning, middle, and through end, with your program.</li>
            </ol>
            
         </li>
         <li audio="3b">
            <b>Submitting your code</b>: As you work on your project, save often and make backup copies so you can
            easily recover in the case of an accident.  You will turn in your BlueJ project 
            as part of your assignment. 
         </li>
         <li audio="3c">
            <b>Working in pairs</b>: This is up to your teacher.  We encourage it, however,
            if you have a choice.  Professional programmers work in teams of all sizes,
            and learning the skills of cooperative programming is very important.  We 
            especially encourage it for students that feel they are capable enough
            to do the project on their own.  Sure, you might be able to, 
            but you won't learn as much, and your project probably won't be as good!  
            Ask your teacher for his/her policy.
            </li>
            
         <li audio="3e">
            <b>Grading</b>: Your teacher will have details about how your project will
            be graded.  However, there are generally several factors that go into a grade:
            <ol>
               <li>Functionality: does your code work? Do you test cases exercise 
               all of your code?</li>
               <li>Appropriateness: is your code well written?  Did you approach the 
               task in the right way?  Is your code easy to read?  Are there clear,
               concise, and accurate comments throughout?</li>
               <li>Project writeup: Does your writeup contain all the necessary parts?
               Is it accurate?</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </>
