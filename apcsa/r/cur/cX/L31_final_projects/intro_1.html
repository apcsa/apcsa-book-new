         We've got three project ideas for you, each designed to take 
         several weeks of your dedicated class time.    So, depending on  
         how much of the school year is left, you won't be able to 
         work on all of them.

         If you are taking this course with a teacher, they will 
         have some opinion about what you should work on and how you  
         should proceed.  If you 
         don't have a teacher, read through the project descriptions 
         that follow and do what you like.

               <b>Adventure</b>: This is an extension of the project and code 
               you worked on at the end of the <i>Inheritance</i>
               unit, in 
               lesson 18.  For the final project, though, you'll get 
               a much large chunk of time to do something interesting
               and creative.  We
               have suggestions.

               <b>Connect 4</b>: You've probably played this game&mdash;two 
               players take turns dropping pieces into a vertical  
               game board, and the one who gets four of his or her pieces 
               in a row wins.  In this project, however, you'll make  
               a game that can work for more than two players, can have any 
               sized board (which changes the strategy somewhat), and lets  
               players drop "bombs" that remove already dropped 
               pieces (which changes the strategy <i>a lot</i>).

               Your big
               task, though, is to write a computer player that plays
               with some smarts. We provide quite a bit of framework
               code in this project.

               <b>Aces Up</b>: This is a solitaire card game which
               involves grouping and removing cards as you deal them
               out of a standard deck.  There is some strategy involved,
               but not too much.  <br><br>
               We provide a Card class that can draw its instances with
               a nice picture, but you'll do the bulk of the work setting
               up, drawing, running the game.
