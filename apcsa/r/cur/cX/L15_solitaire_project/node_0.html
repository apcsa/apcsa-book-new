      <body>
         <p audio="1">
            Elevens is played with the
            deck of 52 cards, with ranks: A (ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
            J&nbsp;(jack), Q (queen), and K (king), and suits: &clubs; (clubs), &diams; (diamonds),
            &hearts; (hearts), and &spades; (spades). 
            <br><br>Here is how you play:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li audio="2">
                 Shuffle the deck. 
            </li>
            <li  audio="3">
           
                  Deal <tt>k</tt>
                  cards from the deck to the table.
            </li>
            <li audio="4">
             
                  Repeat the following:
                  <br>
                  Remove each pair of numeric cards (A, 2, ..., 10) that total 11, 
                  e.g. by removing an 8 and a 3 or a 10 and an A.  
                  Remove face cards in triplets (J, Q, and K). 
                  Ignore suits when determining what to remove. 
                  Deal cards from the deck to replace the cards just removed.
                  If you can't remove any cards, you lose.
            
            </li>
            <li audio="5">
                  You win if you go through the entire deck and remove all the cards.
