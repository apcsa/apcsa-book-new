You now have two tasks to complete.
</p>
 <ol>
<li>
<p>
Provide a method named <tt>play</tt> that plays a game of Elevens
and returns an <tt>int</tt>: 1 if the game was won, 0 if it was lost.
</p>
</li>
<li>

      <p audio="1">
         Your task is to determine the value of <tt>k</tt>
         such that at least 
         one quarter (25%) of the games are winning ones.
         </p>
         <p audio="2"> Specifically, you should find the least 
         value of <tt>k</tt>
         such that, 
         when 500 games of Elevens are 
         played using that value of <tt>k</tt>, at
         least 125 of the games are won.
      </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This may seem like a large assignment.
However, you've already dealt with some of its components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>activities with decks of cards in lessons 12 and 14;</li>
<li>the Monty Hall simulation in lesson 11.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Don't be reluctant to reuse code from these activities.
