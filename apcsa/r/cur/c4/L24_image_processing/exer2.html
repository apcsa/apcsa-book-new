      <title>Enhancing the contrast in an image.</title>

         Images can often have low contrast because the values of their 
         pixels only span part of the 0-255 range of possible values.  This can 
         make images "too dark" (if the values are all too low) or "washed out" 
         (if the values are all too high).  
         A simple way to increase the contrast in an image therefore is 
         to scale the values so they fill this range. This is called 
         "contrast stretching", and is very similar to normalizing with sounds.
      </p>

      <ul>
         <li audio="3">
            As with normalizing, you will need to first find the minimum and maximum values, 
            and then use algebra to extend that range to the full 0-255 that is possible.
            You'll want to do your calculations using doubles, and then cast the 
            result back into an integer. 
         </li>
         <li audio="3b">
            You should stretch each of the color channels separately.  Do this smartly, however: 
            don't write a separate loop to contrast stretch each color!
         </li>
      </ul>

            Create a method called <tt>contrastStretch</tt>
