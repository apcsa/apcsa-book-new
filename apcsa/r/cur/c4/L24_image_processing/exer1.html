         In this exercise you will create a mirror image from a file.
         To do this, you need to modify one half of the picture so that
         it shows a 'reflection' of the other half.  It will look as if
         half a picture is being held up to a mirror.
      </p>
 
      <p audio="3">
         To do this, you will be throwing out half of the information 
         in the picture.  And, you won't see any effect when pictures 
         are already symmetric.

            of the right side.

         Faces are particularly interesting when made into mirror
         images, although you may need to adjust where the center line is.
