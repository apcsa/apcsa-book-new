(This problem appeared on the 1988 AP CS exam.)
</p>
<p>
Write a procedure <tt>Expand</tt> that expands its first argument, <tt>M</tt>, 
which is a matrix of numbers, by an amount specified by its second argument,
<tt>Factor</tt>, which is a nonnegative integer.
(A matrix is a two-dimensional table.)
In particular, if <tt>M</tt> starts with <tt>r</tt> rows and <tt>c</tt> columns
and if the value of <tt>Factor</tt> is <tt>k</tt>, then <tt>M</tt> is returned as a matrix of <tt>k*r</tt> rows and <tt>k*c</tt> columns, 
where each element <tt>e</tt> of the original matrix is replaced by a <tt>k</tt>-by-<tt>k</tt> matrix, all of whose elements are <tt>e</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The matrix passed to <tt>Expand</tt> is to be of type <tt>MatrixType</tt>,
which contains a two-dimensional array such that the element in the <tt>i</tt>th row
and <tt>j</tt>th column of the matrix is in the <tt>[i, k]</tt> position of the array.
</p>
<p>
The effect of the call <tt>Expand(M, 3)</tt> is shown in the diagram below.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Value of <tt>M</tt> at the time of the call</td><td>Value of <tt>M</tt> upon return from the call</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
7 2 3
4 8 6
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Assume the following declarations.
</p>
<pre>
const
   MaxSize = &lt;<i>some large integer constant</i>&gt;
type
   MatrixArray = array[1..MaxSize, 1..MaxSize] of integer;
   MatrixType = record 
      Numbers: MatrixArray;
      NumRows: integer;
      NumCols: integer
   end;
</pre>
<p>
Because each variable of type <tt>MatrixType</tt> takes up a significant amount
of memory, you cannot assume that a second variable of type <tt>MatrixType</tt>
would fit in memory. Thus, <b>you will receive no credit if you make use of any
array variable other than the one passed into the procedure</b>.
</p>
<p>
You may find it helpful to write and call an auxiliary proedure that assigns a value to every element of a rectangular portion of a two-dimensional array.
