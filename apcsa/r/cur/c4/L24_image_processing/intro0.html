      In this lesson you will be manipulating and 
      transforming images. 
      We'll treat an image as three distinct two-dimensional arrays which
      combine to describe the color at each point in the image.
      <p audio="3" class="quoteBrown">
         The goal in this lesson
         is to give you practice with two-dimensional array 
         manipulation where you can <i>see</i>
         what
         you are doing.
