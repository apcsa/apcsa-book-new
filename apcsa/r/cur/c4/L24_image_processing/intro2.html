         We've provided a simple class for you to write methods within, and
         created another class to hide away most of the "ugliness" of converting
         image formats, saving to disk, and so forth.

      <div class="openbluejproj" project="lesson24/ImageProcessor">
         <p audio="3">
            Open the current BlueJ step.
            <br>
            
            (This is <tt>lesson24/ImageProcessor</tt>)
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="4">
         Of the two classes, you will work entirely 
         in the <tt>RGBImage</tt>
         class.  (Feel 
         free to look inside the <tt>Helper</tt>
         class 
         if you really want to). 
      </p>
      <p audio="5">
         Open the <tt>RGBImage</tt>
         class.  Near the top you will see the 
         central data objects of an image: 
               </p>
               <pre class="width50">    private int red[][];
    private int green[][];
    private int blue[][];</pre>
    
    <p audio="6">These three arrays carry the 
    red, green, and blue values for each pixel.  Thus,
    the color of the upper left pixel in the image
    is determined by <tt>red[0][0]</tt>, 
    <tt>green[0][0]</tt>, and
    <tt>blue[0][0]</tt>.  The size of these arrays will be set
    automatically by the image that you have loaded.  (We won't be
    changing image sizes in this lesson, just manipulating the 
    pixel colors).
    </p>
    <p audio="7">Most of the methods in the <tt>RGBImage</tt>
    class are to help you create an instance based on 
    an image in your BlueJ project folder, save 
    your work to the file, and so forth.  Reading the 
    comment above the definition should make things
    clear.  
    Your manipulation
    methods, as we'll talk about next, will be added
    to the end of the file. </p>
