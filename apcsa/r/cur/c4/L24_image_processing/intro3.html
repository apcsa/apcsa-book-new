                 Let's try it out. <br/>
            First, create a new <tt>RGBImage</tt>, choosing the constructor
            without an argument.  This should open up a dialog box
            for you to pick an image from what we've provided.       
         </p>
      </div>
	  
      <br />
	  
      <div class="talkBubble medium_right" char="octal3" align="left" color="orange">
         <p audio="2.f3">
Pick any image you like, although I'm partial to <tt>seagull.jpg</tt>.  From
the BlueJ object, invoke the <tt>flipVertical</tt> method that we've provided
for you.  Kaboom, the seagull is flying!<br /><br />
If you have your own images you want to work on, put them in the <tt>images</tt> 
folder inside this BlueJ project, and open them the same way.  <i>Really</i> large
images might not work well!
         </p>

      <br />
	  
     <div class="talkBubble medium_right" char="twitterton3" align="right" color="green">
         <p audio="3.m4">
Try clicking on the image, and you'll see a message printed out in the Java
console about where you clicked and what the RGB values are there.  Click on 
various colored regions of the image, and see if the RGB values make sense.
