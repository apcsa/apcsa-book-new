         An color image can be considered to be made up of many individual
         dots of color, arranged in a two dimensional grid.  This is the 
         same concept that was introduced in the lesson on graphics, and
         the dots have the same name: a <span class="vocab" term="pixel">pixel</span>.

      <p audio="3">There are many ways to represent a color.  We will
      use one of the most common, the 
      <span class="vocab" term="RGB color model">RGB color model</span>.  As shown at the left,
      the colors red, green, and blue can be combined (added together)
      to make any other color.  These are called the three
      <span class="vocab" term="color channel">color channels</span>
      of an RGB image.

         For our images, we'll let the amount of each color range from
         <tt>0</tt> (no color at all) to <tt>255</tt> 
         (full saturation of that color).
         Each pixel, then, is represented by a set of three numbers, like
         <tt>(255,0,200)</tt>, which would be a very purple dot: full
         red, no green at all, and quite a bit of blue.
