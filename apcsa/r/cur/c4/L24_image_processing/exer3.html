      <title>Thresholding: making true black and white images</title>
   </head>

      <p audio="2">
         Thresholding is a way of converting an image such that it contains only 
         two possible colors for each of its pixels. 
         Generally, these are set to be pure white and pure black.  When thresholding, 
         there is a <span class="vocab" term="threshold value">threshold value</span>, between 0 and 255, that 
         controls which of the two possible values a pixel is set to. 
      </p>

      <p audio="3">
         Thresholding is used to find details in images that might otherwise be lost due
         to the similarity of values.   With the right threshold value, those details
         will become much more visible.

      <div class="tryit">
         <p audio="3">
            Create a method called <tt>threshold</tt>
            that takes an integer 
            threshold value between <tt>0</tt>
            and <tt>255</tt>, and transforms 
            the image appropriately.

               <p audio="4">
            Does it make a difference whether you threshold each color channel separately,
            or take an average of the three (for a pixel) first?   Try it both ways (making
            two separate methods) and test it.
