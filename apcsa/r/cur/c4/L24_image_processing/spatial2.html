         Test images with the following 3x3 filters, as well as 5x5 filters
         designed to do the same task (you will have to design these yourself;
         most will be easy to create, but the sharpening may take some 
         experimentation):

     <p class="quoteBrown">Hint: Make sure to write a method called something
     like <tt>applyFilterToPixel</tt>, which will be called for each pixel in the
     image.  If you don't, you'll have too many nested loops!<Br /> <br/>
     Also, think about
     where in the program you'll deal with the special cases at the edge of 
     the filter.  The possible solutions will work differently depending
     on which filter is being applied.</p>
