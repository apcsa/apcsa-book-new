         An image can be converted to <span class="vocab">greyscale</span> (making it
         a "black and white" image, although pixels will be various shades of grey).
         To do this, you need to set all three color channels to the same value.
         However, you have to do this while maintaining the differences in 
         brightness across the pixels.
      </p><br />
      <p audio="3">
         There a many ways to do this.  The easiest it to set each of the 
         red, green, and blue values for a pixel to the 
         <span class="vocab" term="average">average</span> of 
         the three.

            Create a method called <tt>makeGreyscale</tt> that changes
            the red, green, and blue channels to make a picture "black
            and white".  
         </p>
      </div>
      <p audio="5">Remember, after you are done changing the values in
      the objects <tt>red</tt>, <tt>green</tt>, and <tt>blue</tt> instance
      variables, you need to call the method <tt>refresh</tt>
      in order to see the changes.</p>
