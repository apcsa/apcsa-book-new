<p audio="2">Finally, we consider the case where <tt>add</tt> is called when the myElements array is full.</p>

<p audio="3">We noted earlier that the number of elements an array can hold is fixed when that array is initialized. Thus we cannot
expand the <tt>myElements</tt> array. What we can do is construct <i>another</i>, bigger array, copy the elements from <tt>myElements</tt>
into it, and then replace <tt>myElements</tt> by the new array.</p>

<p audio="4">Here's the code:</p>

<pre>
public void add (Object obj) {
   if (myElements.length == myElemCount) {
      Object [ ] temp = new Object [2*myElemCount];
      for (int k=0; k&lt;myElemCount; k++) {
         temp[k] = myElements[k];
      }
      myElements = temp;
   }
   // Now there is room for the new element.
   // Add it as was described earlier.
}
</pre>
