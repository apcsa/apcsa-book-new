<p audio="1">Write and test a method named <tt>huntSucceeds</tt> to play "Treasure Hunt". In this game, you are given an
initial clue, which leads you to the place of the next clue, which leads you to the next, and so on. Occasionally you will
reach a dead end, in which case you lose. The "clues", for this problem, are nonnegative index values in an array; the value
in an array element tells you the position of the next element to examine. A position outside the array means you win. A
position you've been to before means you lose. In the example array below, starting at position 1 leads you to 3, then 8,
then 4, then 2, and you win. Starting at 6 leads you to 9, then 5, then 7, then 9 where you've been before, so you lose.</p>

<p audio="3">Your <tt>huntSucceeds</tt> method should take a starting position as argument&mdash;a nonnegative integer
less than the number of elements in the array&mdash;and return a boolean indicating whether or not you win when starting the
treasure hunt in the given position. It's OK to change the values in the array while you search, for instance by storing
negative values on top of clues you've seen before. Add your method to the program below.</p>
<pre>
public class TreasureHunt {

   int [ ] myClues = {0, 3, 99, 8, 2, 7, 9, 9, 4, 5};

   public TreasureHunt ( ) {
   }
   
   // Plays the Treasure Hunt game, returning true
   // if we win and false if we lose..
   public boolean huntSucceeds (int start) {
      // You fill this in.
   }
}
