<title>Running Java programs without BlueJ, revisited</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="2">When we discussed static methods, we briefly mentioned the special static method named <tt>main</tt> that is
executed when a Java program is run without BlueJ. Its header is</p>

<pre>
public static void main (String [ ] args)
</pre>

<p audio="3">The last thing to learn about <tt>main</tt> is its argument, an array of <tt>Strings</tt>. In a system with
a command-line user interface, one would run a compiled Java program with the command <tt>java</tt> followed by the name of
the class whose <tt>main</tt> method is to be executed first. It is also possible in this command to provide text information
to the program about to be run, by adding extra arguments to the command. These extra arguments are passed to <tt>main</tt>
in the <tt>args</tt> array.</p>
<p audio="4">Here's an example. Suppose the main method for the Name class is run with the command</p>

<pre>
java Name jesse colin young
</pre>

<p audio="5">Then <tt>args[0]</tt> would contain <tt>"jesse"</tt>, <tt>args[1] "colin"</tt>, and <tt>args[2] "young"</tt>
when <tt>main</tt> is entered.</p>
