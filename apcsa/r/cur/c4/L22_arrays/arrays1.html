The type of an array is the type of its elements followed by a pair of square brackets.
For example, an array of <tt>int</tt> values has type <tt>int [ ]</tt>;
an array of <tt>Refillable</tt> objects has type <tt>Refillable [ ]</tt>.
Thus, we can declare an array by giving its type along with its name,
for example:
</p>
<pre>
int [ ] monthLengths;
ArrayList&lt;Card&gt; [ ] stacks;
String [ ] monthNames;
</pre>
