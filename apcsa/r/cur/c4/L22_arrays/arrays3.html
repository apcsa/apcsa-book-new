The second way combines declaration and initialization.
We declare the array as described earlier, add an equals sign,
and then specify the elements of the array explicitly
inside braces, separated by commas. 
We don't specify the type or number of elements in the array;
those are determined from what we include between braces.
</p>
<pre>
int [ ] monthLengths = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
String [ ] monthNames = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
   "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};
</pre>
<p audio="2">
In either case, the number of elements in the array is fixed after initialization.
We can't change, say, the number of names in <tt>monthNames</tt> without creating a complete
new array.
