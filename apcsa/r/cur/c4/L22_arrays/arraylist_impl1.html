<p audio="2"><tt>ArrayLists</tt> have two instance variables. One,
which we'll call <tt>myElements</tt>, is an array that contains the list
elements. (The array will typically be larger than what's needed to
store the elements.) The other is an <tt>int</tt> that we'll call
<tt>myElemCount</tt>; it contains the number of elements currently in the list.
</p>

<!--  TODO we need this image! -->
<!-- 
<p>The figure below displays the contents of these variables after three
strings have been added to a newly instantiated
ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. The shaded elements are so far not in use.</p>
 -->
 



<p audio="3">The one-argument <tt>add</tt> method merely stores
the new element in the first shaded spot, then increments the element
count. (We'll shortly investigate what happens when the array is
full.)</p>
