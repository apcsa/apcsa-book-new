(This problem is adapted from a free-response question on the 1988 AP CS exam.)
</p>
 
<p>
Consider a class named <tt>Image</tt> that represents an black-and-white image.
Its instance variable is a rectangular two-dimensional array of nonnegative integers,
which we'll call <tt>myImage</tt>.
each integer representing one of the pixels in the image. (The darker the pixel,
the bigger the corresponding array element, and vice versa.)
</p>
<p>
Provide a <tt>public void</tt> method named <tt>zoomOut</tt> that expands <tt>myImage</tt>
by an amount specified by its positive integer argument, which we'll call <tt>factor</tt>.
In particular, if <tt>myImage</tt> starts with <tt>r</tt> rows and <tt>c</tt>
columns and if the value of <tt>factor</tt> is <tt>k</tt>, then
<tt>myImage</tt> is replaced by a two-dimensional array with <tt>k*r</tt> rows and <tt>k*c</tt>
columns, where each element <tt>e</tt> of <tt>myImage</tt> is
replaced by a <tt>k</tt>-by-<tt>k</tt> array, all of whose elements are
<tt>e</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The effect of the call <tt>zoomOut(3)</tt> is shown in the diagram below.
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Value of <tt>myImage</tt> at the time of the call</td><td>Value of <tt>myImage</tt> 
upon return from the call</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
7 2 3
4 8 6
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
7 7 7 2 2 2 3 3 3
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
4 4 4 8 8 8 6 6 6
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Because each <tt>Image</tt> takes up a significant amount
of memory, you cannot assume that a second <tt>Image</tt> object
would fit in memory. Thus, <b>you will receive no credit if you make use of any
array variable other than the one passed into the procedure</b>.
</p>
<p>
You may find it helpful to write and call an auxiliary procedure that assigns a value 
to every element of a rectangular portion of a two-dimensional array.
