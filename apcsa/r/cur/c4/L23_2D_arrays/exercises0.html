In a game like chess or checkers, the game board is normally placed 
between the players, and they sit on opposite sides. 
Thus, the two players see the board from different perspectives. 
Opposite views of a 3-by-3 Tic-Tac-Toe board, for instance, might be as follows:
</p>
<pre class="width40">
xox        oxo
ox          xo
oxo        xox
</pre>

Implement and test a class representing a 19-by-19 game board. 
Your representation should be a two-dimensional array of one-character strings,
all initially set to a period ("."). 
Your class should include three public member functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li audio="4">
A constructor, which initializes all the cells to a period.
</li>

<li>
<span audio="5"><tt>void setCell (int player, int row, int col, String c)</tt><br />
stores the given <tt>String</tt> argument at board position <tt>[row][col]</tt>, 
computed from the given player's perspective. 
For example, on the 3-by-3 board that, 
viewed from player 0's perspective, contains</span>

<pre class="width40">
xox
ox.
oxo
</pre>
<br />
<span audio="6">
changing board cell [0][2] to <tt>"M"</tt> from player 0's perspective 
would result in the board</span>
<br />
<pre class="width40">
xoM
ox.
oxo
</pre>
<span audio="7">
while changing board cell [0][2] to <tt>"M"</tt> 
from player 1's perspective would result in the board
</span>
<br />
<pre class="width40">
xox
ox.
Mxo
</pre>
</li>
<li audio="8">
<tt>void print (int player)</tt></br>
prints the board from the given player's perspective.
The players are numbered 0 and 1, 
and the rows and columns of the board are numbered from 0 to 18. 
</li>
</ul>
<div class="talkBubble medium_right" align="left" color="orange" char="octal2">
<p audio="9.f3">
You need not error-check the arguments to <tt>setCell</tt> and <tt>print</tt>.
</p></div>
