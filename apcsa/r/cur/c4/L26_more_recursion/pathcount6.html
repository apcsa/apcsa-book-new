To settle the case where <tt>n</tt> and <tt>k</tt> are both 0&mdash;how many paths
are there from a point to itself&mdash;we consider <tt>pathCount (0, 1)</tt>.
The return value for this call should be 1.
In the code just designed, we treated this as a base case,
but suppose we hadn't done that.
We would then compute <tt>pathCount(-1,1) + pathCount(0,0)</tt>.
<tt>pathCount(-1,1)</tt> returns 0 because of the other base case.
Thus <tt>pathCount(0,0)</tt> should be 1.
