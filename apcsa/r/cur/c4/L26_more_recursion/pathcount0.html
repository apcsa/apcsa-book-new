Consider now the problem of counting paths from one point to another on a rectangular grid
that only involve moves of length in a south or east direction.
We'll assume that paths start at <tt>(0,0)</tt> and end at <tt>(n,k)</tt>,
and will design a method named <tt>pathCount</tt> that takes <tt>n</tt> and <tt>k</tt>
as arguments.

The diagram below illustrates two paths going from <tt>(0,0)</tt> to <tt>(3,4)</tt>.
