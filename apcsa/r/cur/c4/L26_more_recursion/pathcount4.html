<p audio="2">Some consideration about what "nearer to the base cases" means suggests that it will help to consider paths
that are one step shorter than paths to <tt>(n,k)</tt> and for which supplying one step extends the path to <tt>(n,k)</tt>.</p>

<p audio="3">The problem statement says that every step in a path being counted has to go south or east. That means that the paths
from <tt>(0,0)</tt> to <tt>(n,k)</tt> can be divided into two groups:</p>

<p audio="4" class="quoteBrown">those whose last step is a move south from <tt>(n,k-1)</tt></p>

<p audio="5" class="quoteBrown">...and those whose last step is a move east from <tt>(n-1,k)</tt>. These two groups cover all the
paths from <tt>(0,0)</tt> to <tt>(n,k)</tt> without any duplication.</p>
