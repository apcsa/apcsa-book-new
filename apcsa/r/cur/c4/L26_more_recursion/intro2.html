<p audio="1">To understand how the revised <tt>sumHelper</tt> works, we repeat the steps covered earlier:</p>
<ol>
		<li audio="2">Examine the base case. There's only one base case, and it returns the correct value for an empty interval.</li>
			
		<li audio="3">Try arguments that are one recursive call away from a base case. This would be a one-element interval (for which <tt>left
		== right</tt>), say, with <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> both equal to 4. It computes <tt>mid = (left+right)/2</tt>, which is
		4, and adds that to the values returned by <tt>sumHelper (4, 3)</tt> and <tt>sumHelper (5, 4)</tt>, which are both 0. So
		far, so good.</li>
		
		<li audio="4">Let's now try a three-element interval, namely <tt>[4,6]</tt>. <tt>mid</tt> is <tt>(4+6)/2</tt>, which is 5; the
		recursive calls are <tt>sumHelper (4, 4)</tt>, which returns 4 as just described, and <tt>sumHelper (6, 6)</tt>, which
		returns 6.</li>
</ol>
