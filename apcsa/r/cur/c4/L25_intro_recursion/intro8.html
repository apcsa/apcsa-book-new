If you're working in a class of at least five people,
you can act out a recursive method.
Form a line of four people,
and give each of the four a copy of the following.
</p>

<ol>
<li audio="3">

Wait for the person ahead of you in line to tell you a string.

</li>
<li audio="4">

If he or she tells you the empty string, tell him or her 0.

</li>
<li audio="5">

Otherwise, tell the next person in line the string
that results from removing the first character in the string you were told.
Wait for that person to tell you a number.
Then add 1 to that number, and tell it to the person who originally
told you the string.
