We have earlier seen iterative implementations of array operations.
Now we'll examine some of their recursive counterparts in the context
of a class that represents a set of integers, specifically an implementation 
that internally is unordered and may contain
duplicate elements.  Thus the set {1,3,9} might be represented by arrays 
containing any of the following:
</p>
<pre class="width40">
9   3   9   1
1   3   9
1   1   1   1   1   9   3
</pre>
<p audio="3">
The instance variables for this class are
</p>
<pre audio="width80">
// The elements of the set, unordered, possibly containing duplicates.
private int [ ] myElements;
// The number of myElements cells being used for set elements.
private int myElemCount;
</pre>
   </body>
</html>
