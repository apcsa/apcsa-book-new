      <title>A method calling itself?</title>

Suppose we have a method named <tt>doIt</tt> that contains a call to itself 
that's always executed. What would happen?  The initial call to <tt>doIt</tt> would
</p>
<ul>
<li><span audio="3">call <tt>doIt</tt>, which would</span>
	<ul>
	<li><span audio="4">call <tt>doIt</tt>, which would</span>
		<ul>
		<li audio="5">call <tt>doIt</tt>, and so on ...</li>
		</ul>
	</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p audio="6">
Either this would go on forever, or it would crash somehow.
</p>
<p audio="7">
But now suppose that the call is <i>guarded</i>, so that it sometimes returns
rather than calling itself.
Execution might then proceed as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><span audio="8">call <tt>doIt</tt>, which would</span>
	<ul>
	<li><span audio="9">call <tt>doIt</tt>, which would</span>
		<ul>
		<li audio="10">call <tt>doIt</tt>,which would return </li>
		</ul>
	<span audio="11">which would return</span></li></ul>
<span audio="12">which would return</span></li></ul>
<p audio="13">
That's how we'll structure our own recursive code.
