Here's an example of a recursive method.
</p>
<pre class="width70">
// Find the number of characters in a nonnull 
// (though possibly empty) string.
public static int charCount (String s) {
   if (s.equals("")) {
      return 0;
   } else {
      return 1 + charCount (s.substring(1));
   }
}
</pre>

Observe the two cases in this method.
One, the <span class="vocab" term="base case">base case</span>, doesn't include a call
to <tt>charCount</tt>.
The other, the <span class="vocab" term="recursive case">recursive case</span>, does.
The call to <tt>charCount</tt>, however, has an argument that has one fewer character
than the argument passed originally to <tt>charCount</tt>.
This helps ensure that execution will eventually reach the base case.
