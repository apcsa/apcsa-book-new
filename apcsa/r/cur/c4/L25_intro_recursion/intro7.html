               A recursive call inside a method essentially creates a "clone" of the method.
               The clone has copies of the arguments from its original caller.
               When the clone is executed, it may set up another clone
               with a copy of its arguments.
               <br />
               This is recursion!

               As more calls are made, more clones are created and pile up on a stack.
               When a clone finishes, it jumps off the stack and disappears, possibly
               returning a value to the clone that was right underneath it on the stack.
