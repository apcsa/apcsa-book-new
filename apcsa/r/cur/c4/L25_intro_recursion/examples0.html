      <title>Summing over an interval</title>
   </head>
   <body>
<p audio="2">
Consider an <tt>Interval</tt> class that represents a collection
of consecutive integers.  For example, the interval [3,5]
represents the set {3, 4, 5}.
An interval whose starting value is greater than its ending value&mdash;for
example, [5,3]&mdash; is empty.
</p>
<p audio="3">
A framework for this class appears below.
It refers to the starting value in this interval as <tt>myLeft</tt> 
and the largest value as <tt>myRight</tt>,
and contains a method that returns the sum of all the values in this interval.
</p>
<p audio="4">
The <tt>sum</tt> method calls <tt>sumHelper</tt>,
passing it arguments that start out the recursion.
This use of a top-level method to call a recursive "helper" method
is typical in recursive applications.
