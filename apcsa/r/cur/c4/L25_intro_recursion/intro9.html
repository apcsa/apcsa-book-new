There are several steps to understanding a recursion.
</p>
<ol>
<li audio="3">

Examine the base cases.
These should correspond to arguments for which the method can easily handle
or return an answer for without any extra computation.

</li>
<li audio="4">

Try arguments that are one recursive call away from a base case.
Does the recursive call progress toward the base case?
Does the method correctly use the result of the recursive call
to compute its own answer?

</li>
<li audio="5">

Try arguments that are two recursive calls away from a base case.
Ask yourself the same questions: Is there progress toward a base case?
Is the return value used correctly?

</li>
<li audio="6">

By now, you should be seeing a pattern to the calls and returns.
If there's a comment for the method that describes its arguments
and return values, you ought by now to be able to rely on it
without having to trace through multiple calls.
If there's not a comment, you ought now to be able to invent one.
