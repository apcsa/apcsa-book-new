<title>Usefulness of merge sort</title>
</head>
<body>
<p audio="2">Why is merge sort relevant? Because it needs significantly fewer comparisons than insertion sort or
selection sort to put the array elements in order.</p>

<p audio="3" class="quoteBlue">For example, if <tt>N</tt> is the number of elements in the array to be sorted, both
insertion sort and selection sort may require a number of comparisons proportional to <tt>N<sup>2</sup></tt>, while merge
sort needs only a comparison count proportional to <tt>N log N</tt> ("log" is the logarithm function).</p>

<p audio="4">
This can make a <i>big</i> difference.  For instance, let's say you have a computer that can compare one million pairs of numbers
a second.  If you need to sort one million numbers, merge sort could do this within a few seconds, while 
insertion or selection sort might take several days!</p>
