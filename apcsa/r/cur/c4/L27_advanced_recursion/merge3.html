<p audio="2">Let's give names to the three arrays. The two arrays to be combined we'll call <tt>source1</tt> and <tt>source2</tt>,
and the array into which they'll be combined will be <tt>destination</tt>. Thus:</p>
<table id="tableCenter">
		<tr>
				<th style="border-right: 1px solid #666;"><tt>source1</tt></th>
				<th style="border-right: 1px solid #666;"><tt>source2</tt></th>
				<th><tt>destination</tt></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
				<td style="border-right: 1px solid #666;"><tt>1 4 7 9</tt></td>
				<td style="border-right: 1px solid #666;"><tt>2 3 6 8</tt></td>
				<td><tt>1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9</tt></td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p audio="3">One approach for producing the sorted result is to first search for the smallest element, then the next smallest
element, and so on. Because the arrays being combined are sorted, however, we can do this more efficiently.</p>

<p audio="4">The algorithm uses three index variables. One, which we'll call <tt>ks1</tt>, is the position of the smallest <tt>source1</tt>
element not yet copied into <tt>destination</tt>. The second, which we'll call <tt>ks2</tt>, plays a similar role with <tt>source2</tt>.
The third is the position of the next unfilled spot in <tt>destination</tt>; we'll call that <tt>kd</tt>.</p>

<p audio="5">The main part of the algorithm is a loop that copies the smaller of the two values <tt>source1[ks1]</tt> and <tt>source2[ks2]</tt>
into <tt>destination[kd]</tt>, and then increments <tt>kd</tt> and either <tt>ks1</tt> or <tt>ks2</tt>.</p>
