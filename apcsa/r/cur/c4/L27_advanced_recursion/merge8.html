    <div class="prompt">
     
<p audio="1">
Return to the complete version of merge sort,
and apply the steps discussed earlier for understanding a recursion: <ol><li audio="3">Examine the base cases. These should correspond to arguments for which the method can easily handle or return an answer for without any extra computation. </li> <li audio="4"> Try arguments that are one recursive call away from a base case. Does the recursive call progress toward the base case? Does the method correctly use the result of the recursive call to compute its own answer? </li> <li audio="5"> Try arguments that are two recursive calls away from a base case. Ask yourself the same questions: Is there progress toward a base case? Is the return value used correctly? </li> <li audio="6"> By now, you should be seeing a pattern to the calls and returns. If there's a comment for the method that describes its arguments and return values, you ought by now to be able to rely on it without having to trace through multiple calls. If there's not a comment, you ought now to be able to invent one. </li> </ol> </br>What is the hardest part of this algorithm to understand?
